Text All: The summary states that the patient underwent TAH/BSO, radical cystectomy with ileal conduit, complicated by intra-abdominal infection and pelvic fluid collection. However, the EHR note specifies that the bladder cancer (initially high-grade TCC stage T1) further staged to T4 involving invasion into the bladder wall, perivesical soft tissue, and anterior vaginal wall. This progression of cancer staging is significant and is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.
