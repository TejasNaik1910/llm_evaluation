Human: Fever, Tachycardia, afebrile and stable  (in vital signs) is an overinterpretation as they're not mentioned in the original patient record	
Text All: The Brief Hospital Course section of the Summary mentions that the patient was transitioned to IV ertapenem for 4 weeks. However, the EHR Note indicates that the length of treatment with ertapenem will be determined by fluid collection changes on repeat outpatient imaging. The mention of '4 weeks' in the Summary is therefore not supported by the EHR Note.

Text All: The History of Present Illness section in the Summary states that the patient presented with 2 days of malaise and 1 day of fevers, and initial management included CT-guided JP drain placement for intra-abdominal fluid collection. However, the EHR Note shows that the patient initially presented to an outside hospital (OSH), where she was evaluated with blood cultures, drain culture, started on zosyn and vancomycin, and given acetaminophen before being transferred for further management. The summary omits the initial management at the OSH.
