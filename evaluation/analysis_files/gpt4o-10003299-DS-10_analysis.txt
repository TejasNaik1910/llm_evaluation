CATEGORY: Incorrect Reasoning
Human: under labs results GPT interprets the findings which isn't not mentioned in the original document 
Text All: The EHR_NOTE describes that 'Ms. ___ is a ___ w/ stage IIIA squamous cell carcinoma of lung, s/p completion of concurrent ___ ___, also w/ a h/o multiple strokes w/ residual left hemiparesis, HTN, DL, and prior colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy who is transferred from ___ for continuity of care.' The SUMMARY accurately reflects this information in the 'History of Present Illness' section, stating 'Ms. [Redacted] is a patient with stage IIIA squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, post completion of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. She has a history of multiple strokes with residual left hemiparesis, hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia (DL), and prior colon cancer status post hemicolectomy. She was transferred for continuity of care after presenting with confusion and worsening left upper extremity (LUE) weakness. Imaging revealed bilateral scapular metastases but no new stroke.' There is no chronological inconsistency here, as the sequence of events is correctly presented: patient's completion of cancer treatment, her multiple strokes history, and the transfer for continuity of care after presenting with confusion and worsening weakness. Therefore, no hallucination is detected in this instance.

Human: under labs results GPT interprets the findings which isn't not mentioned in the original document 
Text All: The EHR_NOTE details in its 'History of Present Illness' section that 'Dr ___, the oncology service resident, called me for signout. She presented there on ___ with subacute worsening of her chronic L-sided hemiparesis and confusion.' The SUMMARY captures this sequence in its 'History of Present Illness' by indicating 'She was transferred for continuity of care after presenting with confusion and worsening left upper extremity (LUE) weakness. Imaging revealed bilateral scapular metastases but no new stroke.' Although the exact dates are redacted, the order of events (presenting with confusion and worsening LUE weakness, and subsequent imaging findings) is preserved, indicating there is no chronological inconsistency.
Similarity Score (Human vs All): 0.32901862263679504

Human: under labs results GPT interprets the findings which isn't not mentioned in the original document 
Text All: In the EHR_NOTE, under 'Past Medical History,' it is mentioned that the patient 'was seen by neurology and her head CT and brain MRI did not reveal any new/acute stroke or other acute process.' The SUMMARY correctly reflects this in the 'History of Present Illness' and 'Hospital Course' sections without reversing the order. Thus, the progression from presenting symptoms (throat pain, confusion, worsening L hemiparesis) to the neurological work-up is consistent and not presented out of chronological order.
Similarity Score (Human vs All): 0.4942457377910614

Human: under labs results GPT interprets the findings which isn't not mentioned in the original document 
Text All: The EHR_NOTE lists 'Admission Date: ___ Discharge Date: ___' and details the patient’s hospital journey including diagnostic tests, treatments, and final discharge plans. The SUMMARY mirrors this format, capturing diagnostic efforts (various CTs, MRIs, X-rays) and treatment plans (medication administration and nutritional support) in a coherent sequence. The final discharge condition and instructions in the SUMMARY match the natural hospitalized sequence confirmed in the EHR_NOTE. There’s no indication events are out of order or misrepresented chronologically.
