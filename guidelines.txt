(1a) Patient Information
This section contains demographic details and non-medical information about the patient’s background. This includes personal data such as name, age, gender, ethnicity, race, and address.


Positive Examples:
Omission Example Explanation 1: Hallucination detected. The EHR note specifies that the patient is male by including "Sex: M." However, the summary does not mention the patient's gender at all. This omission can lead to a lack of clarity about the patient's demographic information, which is important for accurate medical documentation and understanding the patient's background. Including gender information helps provide a complete picture of the patient’s identity and can be relevant for understanding certain medical conditions or treatments. The omission of gender information from the summary thus represents a hallucination by omission.


Incorrect Example Explanation 1: Hallucination detected. The EHR does not specify the patient's age, simply referring to the individual as a "gentleman." However, the summary describes the patient as "middle-aged," which introduces an assumption about the patient's age range not supported by the source document. This discrepancy could potentially mislead readers about the patient's exact age, impacting the interpretation of the medical information and any related decisions. Such an inferred detail can lead to inaccuracies, making it an incorrect hallucination regarding the patient's information.


Negative Examples:
Explanation 1: Hallucination not detected. The summary accurately reflects the patient's gender as female, which is explicitly mentioned in the abbreviated EHR ("Sex: F"). The patient's gender is correctly documented without any omission or incorrect inference, ensuring that the demographic information is consistent between the EHR and the summary. Therefore, there is no hallucination present, as the summary faithfully represents the patient's gender as specified in the source document.


Explanation 2: Hallucination not detected. The summary correctly refers to the patient as a "gentleman," aligning with the gender information provided in the EHR ("Sex: M"). This consistency ensures that the patient's demographic details are accurately portrayed. The summary also maintains the patient's history and context as described in the EHR without introducing any incorrect or omitted information. Therefore, there is no hallucination observed in the summary regarding the patient's personal information, demonstrating accuracy and reliability in documenting the patient's background.


(1b) Patient History
This section tells us about the history of illness of the patient. It is prone to hallucination when the summary incorrectly states the illness or altogether brings newly introduced health conditions. 


Positive Examples:


Omission Example Explanation 1: Hallucination detected. The summary's oversimplification from "coil embolization" to simply "embolization" neglects crucial specifics of the procedure performed. The term "coil embolization" indicates a specific technique used to block blood flow to the tumor by inserting coils into the blood vessels, which is a more precise intervention than the general term "embolization." Including these relevant details provides important information about the method used, aiding in an accurate understanding of the intervention's intricacies and ensuring that the patient's medical history is thoroughly documented.


Omission Example Explanation 2: Hallucination detected. The summary's use of the term "heart disease" fails to capture the complexity of the patient's cardiac history as detailed in the EHR. The EHR specifies a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia, and cardiac arrest with subsequent dual chamber ICD placement. These details are critical for understanding the patient's overall health condition and managing future treatments. The oversimplification of "heart disease" obscures these critical clinical details, which could lead to incomplete or inaccurate medical records and potentially impact patient care. 


Incorrect Example Explanation 1:  Hallucination detected. The summary incorrectly states that the patient has "GI cancer," while the EHR specifies "rectal cancer." Clinical knowledge is needed to understand that rectal cancer is a subset of gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. However, the EHR explicitly mentions rectal cancer, not general GI cancer. This specificity is important for accurate medical documentation and treatment. The incorrect generalization from rectal cancer to GI cancer represents a misstatement of the patient's condition. Therefore, the summary inaccurately reflects the patient's medical history, leading to an incorrect reasoning hallucination. The summary should maintain the specific condition stated in the EHR to avoid misinterpretation and ensure precise medical records.


Negative Examples:


Explanation 1: Hallucination not detected. All the health conditions stated in the summary, including coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic dysfunction, chronic atrial fibrillation, and rectal cancer, are present in the EHR's History of Present Illness and Past Medical History sections. The summary accurately reflects the patient's significant medical history without omitting or incorrectly stating any conditions. This alignment between the summary and the EHR ensures that there is no hallucination present, maintaining consistency and accuracy in the patient's medical documentation.


Explanation 2: Hallucination not detected. The summary lists the patient's health conditions, including coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), chronic kidney disease stage IV (CKD stage IV), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD), all of which are mentioned in the EHR's History of Present Illness section. Additionally, the summary correctly states the patient's presenting symptoms and diagnosis of bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The summary accurately reflects the patient's medical history as documented in the EHR, indicating no hallucination and ensuring comprehensive and precise medical records.


(1c) Symptoms/Diagnosis/Surgical Procedures
Inconsistencies found in the patient's current visit details. It could be symptoms, diagnosis, or procedures.
Positive Examples:


Omission Example Explanation 1: Hallucination detected. The summary states that the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and bacteremia. However, the source document specifies "Staph Bacteremia" as the discharge diagnosis, not just general bacteremia. This omission of the specific type of bacteremia, "Staph," is significant because it provides crucial information about the type of bacterial infection, which is important for understanding the patient's condition and for determining the appropriate treatment. The summary's omission fails to capture this critical detail, leading to an incomplete and less precise account of the patient's diagnosis.


Incorrect Example Explanation 1: Hallucination detected.  The summary states that the patient denied "leg swelling," whereas the source document mentions that the patient denied "edema." While "leg swelling" and "edema" can be clinically synonymous, the terminology used in medical documentation is crucial for accuracy. The source document's use of "edema" is more specific and clinically precise. The summary's use of "leg swelling" introduces a minor but significant inconsistency in medical terminology. This requires clinical knowledge to understand that they refer to the same symptom, but for clarity and precision in medical records, the exact term used in the source should be maintained.


Negative Examples:


Explanation 1: Hallucination not detected. The summary accurately reflects the patient's symptoms and the major surgical procedure as detailed in the source document. The patient presented with severe back pain radiating down her right leg and underwent lumbar decompression with fusion surgery, which is consistent with the information provided in the EHR. There is no discrepancy or omission in the summary regarding the patient's symptoms or surgical procedure, indicating that the summary is accurate and complete in this regard.


Explanation 2: Hallucination not detected. The summary correctly identifies the patient's symptoms and diagnosis of pancreatitis, as well as the imaging findings that indicate a large infiltrative pancreatic head tumor with metastases. The patient's presentation with progressive epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with the elevated lipase levels and imaging results, are accurately documented in the summary. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer is correctly reflected from the EHR, ensuring there is no hallucination. The summary provides a precise and accurate account of the patient's condition as documented in the source.


(1d) Medicine Related Instructions


This section focuses on identifying and addressing any disparities or discrepancies noted between the medication instructions documented in the summary and those found in the EHR note.


Positive Examples:
Omission Example Explanation 1: Hallucination detected. The summary mentions that the patient is to continue taking warfarin and pantoprazole among other medications. However, it omits a crucial detail from the EHR regarding the duration for which pantoprazole should be taken. The EHR explicitly states that the patient should continue pantoprazole 40mg twice daily for at least 8 weeks. This omission can lead to the patient discontinuing the medication prematurely, potentially compromising their treatment. Accurate medication instructions, including the duration of administration, are vital for ensuring effective patient care and treatment adherence. Therefore, the omission of the specific duration for pantoprazole in the summary represents a significant discrepancy from the EHR instructions.


Incorrect Example Explanation 1: Hallucination detected. The summary states that the patient was discharged with medications for thyroid cancer, high blood pressure, and breast cancer, as well as for pain management. However, the EHR does not explicitly mention specific discharge medications for thyroid or breast cancer. The medications listed in the EHR include Amlodipine, Anastrozole, and Latanoprost, with dosages for some being uncertain and no direct mention of discharge medications for thyroid cancer. This inference in the summary introduces a potential misunderstanding about the medications the patient is expected to take post-discharge. It is critical for the summary to accurately and clearly reflect the discharge medications as documented in the EHR to avoid confusion and ensure the patient follows the correct medication regimen.


Negative Examples:


Explanation 1: Hallucination not detected. The summary correctly reflects the medication instructions provided in the EHR. The EHR lists Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen for breakthrough pain and Docusate Sodium for constipation as the discharge medications. The summary mentions these medications and clearly states their purpose, aligning with the EHR. By accurately detailing the prescribed medicines and their intended use, the summary ensures that there is no misunderstanding or omission in the medication-related instructions. Therefore, there is no hallucination in this instance, as the summary provides a faithful and precise representation of the EHR’s medication instructions.


Explanation 2: Hallucination not detected. The summary accurately conveys the medication instructions as specified in the EHR. The EHR details the patient's admission with difficulty breathing and low blood pressure, leading to a diagnosis of pneumonia and an MRSA infection. The patient was treated with antibiotics, and the EHR instructs that antibiotics should be continued for a total of 2 weeks. The summary repeats this instruction, specifying that the antibiotics should be continued for 2 weeks, matching the EHR’s details. The summary ensures that the duration for the antibiotics is explicitly stated, providing clear and precise medication-related instructions. Consequently, there is no hallucination here, as the summary maintains consistency with the EHR regarding the prescribed medications and their duration.


(1e) Followup 


The medical notes don’t have a particular section containing the follow-up instructions provided to the patient. However, in numerous instances within the note, post-discharge instructions such as appointment rescheduling, and monitoring instructions are provided to the patient. Potential sections in the data that may have follow-up information include discharge diagnosis, discharge condition, and discharge instructions.


Positive Examples:
Omission Example Explanation 1: Hallucination detected. The summary briefly mentions that the patient should follow up with her urologist "in a few weeks," which is a vague and non-specific timeframe. However, the original EHR explicitly states that the follow-up appointment should occur "in 3 weeks." This lack of specificity in the summary constitutes a follow-up omission, as it fails to convey the exact time frame provided in the EHR. Accurate and specific follow-up instructions are crucial for ensuring that the patient adheres to the recommended medical care schedule. By omitting the precise follow-up timeframe, the summary could lead to confusion and potentially impact the patient's health management. Therefore, it's essential for the summary to accurately reflect the explicit follow-up instructions given in the EHR to maintain clear and effective communication.


Incorrect Example Explanation 1: Hallucination detected. The summary mentions that the patient should follow up with her urologist "in 20 days," whereas the original EHR specifies a follow-up timeframe of "3 weeks." Although these timeframes are close, they are not the same and can lead to confusion. In the context of medical instructions, precision is crucial. The discrepancy between "20 days'' and "3 weeks" could cause the patient to schedule the follow-up incorrectly, potentially impacting their continuity of care. It is essential for summaries to precisely reflect the follow-up instructions from the EHR to ensure that patients and healthcare providers have a consistent and clear understanding of the recommended medical care schedule. This example highlights an incorrect follow-up instruction, where the summary inaccurately conveys the timeframe provided in the EHR.


Negative Examples:


Explanation 1: Hallucination not detected. The summary accurately reflects the follow-up instructions as specified in the EHR. The EHR mentions that the patient needs to follow up with the colorectal surgery clinic in 2 weeks, and the summary reiterates this timeframe precisely. The summary states that the patient is discharged with instructions to follow up with the colorectal surgery clinic in 2 weeks, matching the EHR’s details. Therefore, there is no follow-up hallucination here, as the summary provides a clear and specific timeframe for the follow-up, ensuring consistency with the EHR.


Explanation 2: Hallucination not detected. The summary provides detailed follow-up instructions that align with those given in the EHR. The EHR lists specific symptoms the patient should monitor, including fever, increased shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, and incision drainage, and these instructions are clearly outlined in the summary as well. The summary accurately reflects the necessary follow-up actions the patient should take if they experience these symptoms. Therefore, there is no follow-up hallucination, as the summary conveys the exact steps to be followed by the patient, maintaining consistency with the EHR.


Explanation 3: Hallucination not detected. The summary accurately conveys the follow-up instructions provided in the EHR. The EHR specifies that the patient needs to have the IVC filter removed in 3 months and should follow up with cardiology for anticoagulation decisions, GI for further bleeding studies, and hematology for hypercoagulable workup. The summary includes all these details, clearly mentioning the need to follow up with the respective specialties and the timeframe for the IVC filter removal. The summary provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of why the patient needs to follow up with each specialist, ensuring there is no follow-up hallucination. The information is consistent with the EHR, providing clarity and accuracy in the follow-up instructions.


(2a) Chronological Inconsistency 
Mix up in the patient's timeline. The order of medical events isn’t consistent with the EHR. Events are presented in a sequence that does not follow the natural progression as shown in the EHR. For example, an event that supposedly happened after another event is described as occurring before it.


Positive Examples:


Explanation 1: Hallucination detected. The EHR (Electronic Health Record) indicates that Mrs. ___, the patient, was diagnosed with a suspicious thyroid nodule before presenting with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. However, the summary states that the lymphadenopathy appeared first, followed by the thyroid nodule diagnosis. This reversal of the chronological order suggests a Chronological Inconsistency Hallucination. In simpler terms, the summary describes events out of order compared to what the EHR documents.


Explanation 2: Hallucination detected. The summary in this case presents a chronological inconsistency despite individual events seemingly matching the EHR. The issue lies in how the information is presented. The summary states "Breast cancer diagnosed and treated, considering corticosteroid inhaler and albuterol for asthma." This phrasing suggests that the patient's current situation involves a newly diagnosed breast cancer. However, the "History of Present Illness" section clarifies that breast cancer was diagnosed and treated in 2019. This indicates a past event, not a current one. Therefore, the summary creates the illusion (hallucination) that the patient has newly diagnosed breast cancer when, in reality, it's a recurrence of a previously treated condition. This reversal of the implication regarding the current status of breast cancer highlights the chronological inconsistency.


Negative Examples:


Explanation 1: Hallucination not detected. The summary accurately reflects the chronological order of events as documented in the EHR. It begins with the discharge diagnosis, clearly stating the patient's conditions - healthcare-associated pneumonia and Staph bacteremia. It then mentions the medication changes, specifically noting the initiation of vancomycin to treat the bacterial infection. The summary describes the patient's improvement, leading to discharge to extended care, and details the patient's condition at discharge (confused, lethargic, bedbound). Finally, it includes instructions regarding continued antibiotic use and follow-up care. This clear progression from diagnosis to treatment, improvement, and discharge with follow-up instructions demonstrates that the summary maintains the correct chronological order of events in the EHR, with no reversal or mix-up in the sequence of the patient's medical journey.


Explanation 2: Hallucination not detected. This summary effectively maintains the chronological order of events as presented in the EHR. It starts with the patient's demographics (female, age unknown) and diagnoses (alcoholic hepatitis and pancreatitis). The summary describes the patient's hospital journey, mentioning the discovery of a pseudocyst and subsequent transfer for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided drainage. It then details the development of a fever and a possible candidal infection after the procedure, mentions the administration of Micafungin to treat the suspected fungal infection, and provides details regarding discharge to an extended care facility, including instructions to resume regular medications, ambulate, and manage the drain and ostomy care. Finally, it emphasizes the importance of follow-up appointments with the surgeon and primary care physician. This clear progression from initial presentation to procedure, post-operative developments, treatment, discharge plan, and follow-up demonstrates that the summary adheres to the chronological order of events in the EHR, with no reversal or confusion regarding the sequence of the patient's care.


(2b) Incorrect Reasoning
Information is correctly stated in the summary but the associated reasoning given for it does not make sense or is incorrect.


Positive Examples:


Explanation 1: Hallucination detected. The summary prematurely concludes that the patient has a throat infection based solely on the symptoms of an itchy throat, cough, and difficulty in swallowing as described in the EHR note. However, the EHR note does not explicitly diagnose a throat infection, leaving this conclusion speculative. The symptoms could indicate various conditions, and unless explicitly stated in the EHR, concluding a specific diagnosis like throat infection is incorrect. The reasoning behind the conclusion does not have a factual basis from the provided EHR information, leading to incorrect reasoning.


Explanation 2: Hallucination detected. While the summary correctly states the patient's condition of having a T12 lesion suspected to be due to multiple myeloma, the reasoning behind the discharge plan involving radiation therapy is incorrect. Multiple myeloma is typically not treated with radiation therapy as the first-line treatment, especially for bone fractures or lesions. The summary’s reasoning that radiation therapy is part of the discharge plan due to multiple myeloma is factually incorrect and misinterprets standard medical practices for treating this condition. This illustrates incorrect reasoning despite the accurate identification of the condition.


Negative Examples:


Explanation 1: Hallucination not detected. The summary accurately reflects the patient's history and treatment as described in the EHR. It correctly states the patient's conditions (alcoholic hepatitis and pancreatitis), the surgical procedure (endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage of a pseudocyst), subsequent complications (fever and possible candidal infection), and the treatment received (Micafungin). The discharge instructions to resume regular medications, ambulate, and follow up with the surgeon and primary care provider are also consistent with the EHR. There is no incorrect reasoning present, as the summary provides a clear, factual account based on the provided medical information without any speculative or inaccurate conclusions.


(3) Other Inconsistency:
Inconsistencies that do not fit into any of the previously defined categories of hallucinations.
For example: Labs, allergy, family history, response, outcome, and therapeutic procedures.
