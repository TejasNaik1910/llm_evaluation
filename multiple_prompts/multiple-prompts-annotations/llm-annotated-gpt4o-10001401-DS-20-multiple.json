However, it also mentions that she was initially started on a broader spectrum of antibiotics (zosyn and vancomycin) which were later tapered to intravenous zosyn and then transitioned to ertapenem. This discrepancy in the timeline and detailed antibiotic management creates a chronological inconsistency in the summary."

The EHR note indicates that the specific duration of IV ertapenem therapy is to be determined based on outpatient follow-up and repeat imaging results, which means the exact length of treatment is flexible and not definitively set for 4 weeks. Therefore, stating an exact duration of 4 weeks is speculative and reflects incorrect reasoning."
