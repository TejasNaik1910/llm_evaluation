(1e) Followup 


The medical notes don’t have a particular section containing the follow-up instructions provided to the patient. However, in numerous instances within the note, post-discharge instructions such as appointment rescheduling, and monitoring instructions are provided to the patient. Potential sections in the data that may have follow-up information include discharge diagnosis, discharge condition, and discharge instructions.


Positive Examples:
Omission Example Explanation 1: Hallucination detected. The summary briefly mentions that the patient should follow up with her urologist "in a few weeks," which is a vague and non-specific timeframe. However, the original EHR explicitly states that the follow-up appointment should occur "in 3 weeks." This lack of specificity in the summary constitutes a follow-up omission, as it fails to convey the exact time frame provided in the EHR. Accurate and specific follow-up instructions are crucial for ensuring that the patient adheres to the recommended medical care schedule. By omitting the precise follow-up timeframe, the summary could lead to confusion and potentially impact the patient's health management. Therefore, it's essential for the summary to accurately reflect the explicit follow-up instructions given in the EHR to maintain clear and effective communication.


Incorrect Example Explanation 1: Hallucination detected. The summary mentions that the patient should follow up with her urologist "in 20 days," whereas the original EHR specifies a follow-up timeframe of "3 weeks." Although these timeframes are close, they are not the same and can lead to confusion. In the context of medical instructions, precision is crucial. The discrepancy between "20 days'' and "3 weeks" could cause the patient to schedule the follow-up incorrectly, potentially impacting their continuity of care. It is essential for summaries to precisely reflect the follow-up instructions from the EHR to ensure that patients and healthcare providers have a consistent and clear understanding of the recommended medical care schedule. This example highlights an incorrect follow-up instruction, where the summary inaccurately conveys the timeframe provided in the EHR.


Negative Examples:


Explanation 1: Hallucination not detected. The summary accurately reflects the follow-up instructions as specified in the EHR. The EHR mentions that the patient needs to follow up with the colorectal surgery clinic in 2 weeks, and the summary reiterates this timeframe precisely. The summary states that the patient is discharged with instructions to follow up with the colorectal surgery clinic in 2 weeks, matching the EHR’s details. Therefore, there is no follow-up hallucination here, as the summary provides a clear and specific timeframe for the follow-up, ensuring consistency with the EHR.


Explanation 2: Hallucination not detected. The summary provides detailed follow-up instructions that align with those given in the EHR. The EHR lists specific symptoms the patient should monitor, including fever, increased shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, and incision drainage, and these instructions are clearly outlined in the summary as well. The summary accurately reflects the necessary follow-up actions the patient should take if they experience these symptoms. Therefore, there is no follow-up hallucination, as the summary conveys the exact steps to be followed by the patient, maintaining consistency with the EHR.


Explanation 3: Hallucination not detected. The summary accurately conveys the follow-up instructions provided in the EHR. The EHR specifies that the patient needs to have the IVC filter removed in 3 months and should follow up with cardiology for anticoagulation decisions, GI for further bleeding studies, and hematology for hypercoagulable workup. The summary includes all these details, clearly mentioning the need to follow up with the respective specialties and the timeframe for the IVC filter removal. The summary provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of why the patient needs to follow up with each specialist, ensuring there is no follow-up hallucination. The information is consistent with the EHR, providing clarity and accuracy in the follow-up instructions.
