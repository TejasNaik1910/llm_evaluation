            "explanation": "The hospital course in the summary introduces the treatment with IV steroids and PO Augmentin, but then mentions that imaging showed persistent disease, followed by a recommendation for surgery. This sequence is slightly misleading as the decision for surgery was due to refractory disease despite the treatments and was not a subsequent action but part of the clinical reason for the suggestion of surgery."
