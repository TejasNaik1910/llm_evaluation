It's important to note that 'coverage for pneumonia' generally means the treatment is for suspected, not confirmed, pneumonia. This generalization could lead to misinterpretation that pneumonia was definitively diagnosed rather than treated prophylactically."

The reason adds an incorrect reasoning element by not including trialled NIPPV, which might mislead clinicians reading the summary."
