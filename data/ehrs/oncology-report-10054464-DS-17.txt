Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
jaw pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Core biopsy of lesion on back

 
History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yo M with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CAD 
who presents with 6 weeks of increasing jaw pain, found to have 
a R temporal mass on outside hospital imaging and 
lung/adrenal/back masses on imaging here. The patient noted jaw 
pain starting in his R temporal region 6 weeks ago.  He was seen 
by his dentist for this pain who then referred him to an oral 
surgeon for further evaluation. He was seen by an oral surgeon 4 
weeks ago, where he had xrays of his teeth performed. The oral 
surgeon thought the pt may have decay of one of his wisdom 
teeth, so he removed the pts wisdom tooth 2 weeks ago. The 
patient continued to have R jaw pain after the extraction, so 
the oral surgeon arranged for the pt to have a head CT 1 week 
ago. This head CT showed swelling of the right temporalis muscle 
and underlying destruction of the temporal bone. Differential 
diagnosis included lymphoma, metastatic disease, and 
rhabdomyosarcoma. His PCP arranged for him to have an MRI of his 
facial bones this week, but over the past week the patient has 
had increasing R jaw pain. He notes a sharp constant R TMJ pain 
that radiates up to his temple, to the back of his head, and 
down his R jawline.  He has been taking vicodin every ___ hours 
with only minimal relief of symptoms. The pt has been having 
increasing difficulty with opening his mouth due to pain, and 
has had difficulty eating/drinking. He has lost 13 lbs over the 
past ___ weeks, and does endorse mildly decreased appetite. He 
has been mainly only able to tolerate liquids, applesauce, 
pudding, etc. 
.
The patient also notes a mass on his back which he noted also 
about 6 months ago. He presented to his PCP and was told this 
was likely a sebaceous cyst. He notes that this mass has been 
enlarging, but is not tender.
.
The patient denies any nightsweats, lymph node enlargement, 
fevers, chills, rectal bleeding, shortness of breath, chest 
pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, 
or loss of energy. He does admit to ___ months of a 
nonproductive cough. However, over the past 2 weeks since the 
extraction of his wisdom tooth he has been coughing up phlegm 
mixed with a small amount of blood when he awakens in the 
morning.
. 
In the ED, the pts vitals were: T 98.7 BP 168/87 P 90 R 18 Sat 
97%RA. He was given Vicodin ___ mg tablets x2, morphine 4 mg 
IV x2, dilaudid 2 mg IV x1 with no relief of his pain. He also 
received zofran 4 mg IV x1. He was noted to have a lesion on his 
back, and ultrasound revealed this to be a 5 x 5 x3 cm vascular 
mass. He then had a CT of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis which 
showed a 5 cm mass in the left lower lobe with multiple necrotic 
left hilar and left axillary nodes. He was noted to have a 4.3 
cm right adrenal mass, a 2 cm x 1.7 cm enlarged lymph node in 
the right axilla, and a 5 x 7 cm subcutanous mass of the mid 
back. He was admitted for further malignancy work up and 
treatment of his pain.

Imaging:
OSH CT facial bones ___: There is swelling and prominence of 
the right temporalis muscle. There is underlying permeative 
destruction of the temporal squamosa. The process involves the 
temporalis muscle eccentrically along the external aspect of the 
temporal bone. Differential considerations inculde lymphoma or 
rhabdomyosarcoma. Metastatic disease cannot be excluded. The 
maxilla and mandible are unremarkable. 
.
___ Ultrasound of lesion on back:
FINDINGS: Solid mass is located on the midline in the upper 
thoracic region measuring approximately 2.9 x 5.3 x 5.4 cm. The 
mass is extremely vascular. The differential diagnosis includes 
metastic disease and soft tissue sarcomas. 
.
___ Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CT scan:
IMPRESSION:  
1. Left lower lobe lung mass is associated with multiple left 
hilar necrotic nodes and left axillary node. Left pleural mass, 
right adrenal mass and a subcutaneous mass within the upper 
thoracic region are noted. Findings are compatible with 
metastatic disease most likely from primary lung cancer. 
Metastatic melanoma is another likely possiblity. 
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions. 
3. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis. 
.
___ MRI head:
IMPRESSION: 
Dominant enhancing lesion involving squamous and mastoid areas 
of the right temporal bone, right temporalis muscle, with 
associated dural component and enhancement, with mass effect on 
the subjacent right temporal gyri. Enhancing left frontal 
parenchymal lesion, most likely metastasis. Additional small 
enhancing focus in the posterior right occipital lobe, too small 
to definitely characterize as intra- or extra-axial, but given 
presence of disruption of the inner table of the occipital bone, 
probably represents osseous metastasis with dural involvement.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ yo M with a history of HTN, CAD, and hyperlipidemia 
who presents with 6 weeks of increasing jaw pain, found to have 
a R temporal mass on outside hospital imaging and 
lung/adrenal/back masses on imaging here. He was admitted for 
further malignancy work up and pain control.
.
# Lung/Back/Adrenal/R temporal/brain masses, Lung Cancer: CT 
prelim read here notes a 5 cm mass in the left lower lobe with 
multiple necrotic left hilar and left axillary nodes, a 4 cm 
right adrenal mass, and a 5 cm subcutanous mass of the mid back. 
OSH CT of the facial bones revealed R temporalis muscle 
enlargement and underlying destruction of the R temporal bone. 
MRI ___ shows extensive R temporal mass, 2x2cm frontal brain 
lesion, possible occipital lobe lesion as well, all consistent 
with malignancy.  
Surgery was able to perform biopsy on back on ___ - pathology 
returned poorly differentiated carcinoma, likely non-small cell 
lung cancer.  Plan to: 
- oncology  was consulted and ___ appt was set up after 
completion of xRT.
- rad-onc consulted and pt received ___ treatment day of dc, 
which he tolerated well. Pt would get 10 total fraction M-F 
(total 2weeks)

need ___ scans. Pt and family told to report new neurological sx 
to oncologist

well to dilaudid in the ED.

fentanly patch 75mcg Q72 and oral dilaudid 8mg Q4hrs prn which 
appeared to be reducing his pain to a reasonable level. Since pt 
was taking large amounts of oral dilaudid, at ___, fentanyl patch 
dose was titrated up to 100mcg Q72hrs. Pt was advised to not 
drive or operate heavy machinary. Pt was counseled on using 
stool softeners to avoid constipation. Pt had regular BMs during 
hospital stay on prescribed stool softeners.

infection. He has 92% PMN/left shift, but no bands, no atypical 
cells. No apparent current dental infection is noted on exam. Pt 
had low grade temps but no true fever and UA/Cxr/Blood Cx were 
neg. His leukocytosis was likely reactive and was downtrending 
at ___
.

mucous.  ?posterior nasopharynx bleeding versus from lung mass :
- SQ heparin was discontinued and pt had minimal hemoptysis 
thereafter.
.
# Dyspnea: Pt had one episode of subjective dyspnea; likely 
related to anxiety. Pt was initially placed on oxygen for 
comfort but later weaned to off and sats were >95% on RA at dc. 
Pt was started on low dose lorazepam for anxiety and was 
scarcely using it

.
# Hyperkalemia:  Mild.  Unclear etiology.  Tumor lysis labs 
negative, so unlikely this.  Resolved with kayexalate x 1.
