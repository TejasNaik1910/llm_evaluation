overnight. Pt is at baseline orientation per family (knows 
place, situation, DOB, people, location, but not date/year/month 
which is normal)

# HCV/HBC cirrhosis
Has asterixis, unclear if this is baseline or triggered by 
anesthesia, not on hepatic encephalopathy meds. Improved in am 
likely post anesthesia effect.

your right upper abdomen, and nausea/vomiting post this 
procedure. Please check in with your hepatologist if these occur
