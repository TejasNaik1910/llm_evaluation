IMAGING
U/S ___
1.  Patent main portal vein with hepatopetal flow.  Recanalized 
umbilical 
vein. 
2.  Echogenic focus in the right lobe of the liver, most likely 
correlates to 
patient's RFA site.  Additional 1.5 cm echogenic focus along the 
medial edge 
of the right lobe of the liver, difficult to discern whether 
intra- or 
extra-hepatic, no clear correlate on recent prior CT/MRI.  
Correlate with 
nonurgent, multiphase CT or MRI for better characterization. 
3.  Status post cholecystectomy.  Common bile duct not 
identified. 

MRI ___ Prelim
1. Stable size of the previously RF ablated lesion within the 
right lobe of the liver. Perilesional hyperenhancement is again 
noted which may be 
perfusional in nature; however continued surveillance is 
advised. 
2. No lesions suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma. 
3. Features consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. 
4. Replaced left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric 
artery and 
replaced right hepatic artery arising from the superior 
mesenteric artery.  
5. Stable left retroperitoneal cystic lesion, likely 
lymphangioma.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPIAL COURSE
___ yo ___ speaking M with HCV, EtOH cirrhosis, HCC s/p TACE 
x2 and RFA, current MELD score 9, on transplant list recurrent 
C. diff presents with abdominal pain and possible hepatic 
encephalopathy. RUQ U/S showed patent portal vein and a new 
echogenic area in the medial aspect of the right lobe. We 
treated empirically for SBP with CTX and gave albumin, however 
repeat attempt at para found nothing to drain. CTX discontinued 
after one dose and patient remained afebrile. MRI done ___ to 
assess for the mass seen on RUQ did not show changes concerning 
for HCC and AFP was wnl. Lipase/Amylase also normal. Pt was 
maintained on lac/rif. On ___ patient developed headache and 
neck pain. Was afebrile. Given a dose of acyclovir overnight. LP 
in AM showed no evidence of bacterial or viral meningitis. RPR 
negative, C.diff negative. Discharged with lab draw to take 
place on ___ with results to be faxed to Dr. ___ in 
transplant clinic where he has follow up on ___. Sent out on 
home meds (furosemide 40, spironolactone 150, nadolol 20, 
omeprazole 40bid).

ACTIVE ISSUES 
# Abdominal Pain. RUQ U/S did not show obstructive pathology as 
portal vein and umbilical veins are patent. However, it did show 
a new echogenic area in the medial aspect of the right lobe that 
is unable to get correlated with previous scans. In addition, 
given recent report of worsening mental status and abdominal 
pain, we are treating empirically for SBP, however repeat 
attempt at ___ found nothing to drain. Records from ___ 
___ show he did not have a tap then. MRI showed no changes 
concerning for HCC. 
 
# AMS. Likely ___ hepatic encephalopathy vs. infectious (such as 
SBP). UA is unremarkable. RUQ U/S without portal vein 
thrombosis. Lung exam is benign. He denied any respiratory 
symptoms. Continued on lac/rif. Developed headache on ___. 
Initial LP unsuccessful. Overnightw as given a dose of acyclovir 
but LP on ___ showed no signs of meningitis.   

# HCV/EtOH cirrhosis and HCC w/p TACE and RFA. On transplant 
list. RUQ initially concerning for new mass, but AFP wnl and MRI 
did not show changes concerning for new cancer.

# Hct Drop: On ___ had a hematocit drop. Guiaic negative. Pt 
did not endorse melena. Repeat Hct stable. Continued omeprazole 
and nadalol.

INACTIVE ISSUES  
# Ascites. No tapable pocket found on repeat U/S. Initially held 
home lasix and spironolactone, but restarted him on home dose of 
furosemide 40mg and spironolactone 150. 

# RENAL: Crt stable at 0.7  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# f/u CSF HSV PCR, BCX data (NGTD), Lyme serology, EBV IgG, IgM
# f/u ___ lab draw for LFTs, CBC, ___, Chem 7

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure participating in your care. You were admitted 
for abdominal pain and some confusion. Initially we were 
concerned about infection of the fluid in your abdomen. We tried 
to sample fluid from your abdomen to look for infection but 
found none to drain. You remained without signs of infection 
after we stopped antibiotics.

An ultrasound also showed a new mass in your liver, so we did an 
MRI to better assess this mass, and currently we are NOT 
concerned about recurrence of liver cancer.

Please have laboratory studies drawn on ___ and they will 
fax your results to the Transplant Clinic.

Also please keep your appointment with Dr. ___ 
primary care doctor. 

We have given you a medicine, SIMETHICONE for gas pain. 
Otherwise we have not made any changes to your medicines from 
admission. We have given you a prescription for all your 
medicines so that you can be sure of what you should be taking.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
