History of Present Illness:
___ year who was sent in by ___ on ___ after 
experiencing headache and emesis. The headache was acute in 
onset however no headstrike or injuries were reported. She also 
developed bilateral lower extremity weakness requiring her to 
have to walk as she was unsteady on her feet. There was concern 
regarding her presentation as she experienced similar symptoms 
when she had a prior stroke. 

In the ED, initial vitals were: Pain 8, Temperature 96.8, HR 
101, BP 155/93, RR 16, Pulse Ox 99% on RA. Urine/serum 
toxicology screen was negative. UA was negative.  Chemistry 
panel was normal except for a BUN of 24. LFT's were normal 
except for an alk phos of 144. CBC was within normal limits. 

She underwent a CTA head and neck with preliminary reading 
showing "no flow limiting stenosis in the intracranial and 
cervical vessels. No evidence of aneurysm greater than 3 mm or 
dissection. Patent stent graft in the right common carotid 
artery. Calcified and non-calcified plaque at the left carotid 
bifurcation causing mild narrowing. Atherosclerotic 
calcification involving the left greater than right cervical 
vertebral arteries. Severe atherosclerotic disease of the aortic 
arch and descending aorta with both calcified and non-calcified 
plaque. Unchanged 8 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, follow 
up per prior chest CT's." The patient was evaluated by neurology 
who suspected that the patient's current presentation was due to 
sub-acute spinal pathology coupled with ongoing medical illness 
and stress due to home situation. The patient was evaluated by 
___ in the ED who recommended ___ visits or discharge to rehab. 
The patient was admitted to medicine for coordination of care 
and symptomatic management. 

On the floor, the patient reports improvement in her nausea and 
abdominal pain. She has some persistent left lower extremity 
weakness compared to right. She reports intermittent dizziness 
which she describes as the sensation that the room is spinning 
around her. She reports stress regarding her son and his issues 
with addiction, which she has dealt with for some time. She 
reported headache on presentation bi-temporal, which has 
improved. The patient does not remember the exact events when 
she was walking to her closet yesterday morning, but she did not 
experience any prodromal symptoms, nor changes in vision.

IMAGING
=======
___: CTA HEAD AND CTA NECK
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive periventricular and subcortical white matter 
hypodensities,
relatively unchanged compared to the prior MRI allowing for the 
differences in technique.  Please note that evaluation for an 
underlying acute infarct is limited given the extensive 
hypodensities.  MRI of the brain can be performed for further 
evaluation as clinically indicated.
2. Vasogenic edema in the inferior right temporal lobe.  The 
previously known enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe is 
not well visualized on the CT scan.
3. Patent right internal and common carotid artery stent.
4. Atherosclerosis involving the left carotid bifurcation 
without any stenosis by NASCET criteria.
5. Atherosclerosis involving V2 segment of left vertebral artery 
causing focal areas of mild luminal narrowing.
6. Stable 9 mm nodule in the right upper lobe.  Further 
evaluation with
dedicated CT of the chest can be performed as clinically 
indicated.

___: PELVIS (AP ONLY)
FINDINGS: 
No fracture or dislocation.  Bilateral hip joint spaces are 
relatively well
preserved with only minimal degenerative change.  Pubic 
symphysis and SI
joints are preserved.  No radiopaque foreign body.  Contrast is 
seen within
the bladder.
 
IMPRESSION: 
No fracture or dislocation.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: ___ with PMH of HTN, hypothyroidism, head 
and neck cancer s/p neck dissection x2 who presented with 
complaints of vertigo and leg weakness after fall with complex 
social situation concerning for abuse. 

# Vertigo secondary to BPPV versus Social Stressors/Anxiety: Ms. 
___ presented with nausea and dizziness. Based on description 
it appeared the vertigo appeared to be position in nature. Given 
her history of carotid stenosis, a CTA head and neck was 
obtained which did not show any evidence of new acute stroke. 
Neurology was consulted during hospitalization who did not 
believe symptoms could be explained by an acute stroke. Rather, 
they believed the symptoms were consistent with benign 
paroxysmal positional vertigo as neurologic exam was completely 
benign.

During hospitalization, it was also noted that Ms. ___ 
symptoms occurred when she was talking about her stressful home 
situation (a son at home who has a drug addiction and is 
verbally abusive to her). When talking to her son on the phone,

experienced these symptoms when she described her stressful home 
situation to the medical team. These symptoms would resolve 
after she had time to relax.

Neurology did not believe any further work-up was necessary as 
an inpatient and recommended follow up with her Neurologist, Dr. 
___. 

# Social Stressors/Verbal Abuse: Ms. ___ described her 
stressful home situation with her son. She describes her son as 
addicted to crack. She also described numerous episodes of 
verbal abuse to her. She denied any physical abuse. Elder 
services had been involved in the past. Given this description, 
social work was heavily involved during this hospitalization and 
initial mandated reporting was done upon admission. She was 
hesitant to be discharged from the hospital until ___ 
discharge plan was in place. Social work attempted to find other 
places for her to stay, however, patient elected to be 
discharged home. To facilitate a safe discharge plan, plans were 
made with ___ Police if any abuse at home (plan would be

police. Prior to her discharge, Elder Protective Services were 
called for wellness and home safety evaluations to occur at 
home. Ms. ___ was able to voice back the safety plan that was 
developed and reported she felt comfortable with the safety 
plan. Attempts were made to locate safe housing prior to 
discharge,but patient denied further services.

# Bacterial pneumonia: patient recently diagnosed with atypical 
pneumonia at PCP, started on course of levofloxacin ___. 
She completed her 10 day course of levofloxacin on ___. She 
was not experience cough or fever, and remained hemodynamically 
stable during hospitalization. 

# Hypertension: Continued atenolol, chlorthalidone, and aspirin 
during hospitalization.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine during 
hospitalization.

with dedicated CT of the chest can be performed as clinically 
indicated. Of note, this lesion has been documented on previous 
CT scans of the chest.

arch with penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer as seen on image
