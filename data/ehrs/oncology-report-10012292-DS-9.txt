Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
--------------
Video swallowing study:
1. Penetration without frank aspiration. 
2. Upper esophageal stricture. 

CT chest:
Multifocal consolidation in the right lung with mucoid impaction 

and associated nodularity suggests an infectious process. 
Coexistent 
metastatic disease cannot be assessed. Recommend repeat chest CT 
after treatment has been completed. 
Left apical pulmonary nodules which can be evaluated on the 
followup chest CT. 
Indeterminate sclerotic apparently new focus in the mid thoracic 
vertebrae. Uncharacteristic for a papillary thyroid metastasis. 
Recommend attention to this area on followup. 

CXR:
Likely left lower lobe pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w h/o recurrent medullary thyroid carcinoma (s/p 
thyroidectomy and chemo-XRT in ___, h/o PNAs/aspiration due to 
radiation induced esophageal strictures, who now p/w cough and 
nausea.  

# Cough: Pt's pulmonary process was thought to be 
multifactorial, concerning for recurrent aspiration pneumonia vs 
CAP vs flu vs CHF. Pt was initially imaged with CXR and followed 
up with CT scan which showed infectious process with mucous 
plugging and no evidence of progressed malignancy causing 
obstruction. Pt was ruled out for flu and increased cough when 
supine was thought to be more due to aspiration than CHF given 
no other clinical finding of fluid overload. Pt had failed 
azithromycin x 10 days as an outpt and was started on 
Ceftriaxone and Flagyl. Pt did not receive 2 doses of 
Ceftriaxone for unclear reasons without the primary team being 
notified and was quickly restarted once error identified. During 
this time, pt was febrile and sympomatically hypotensive, 
concerning for sepsis. She responded well to 500ml bolus of IVF 
and blood cultures remained negative. Pt was also treated with 
standing nebs, aggressive chest physical therapy and insentive 
spirometry. On discharge, pt was switched to oral regimen for 
another 12 days (Flagyl and Cefpodoxime) as well as prescribed 
inhaler treatments given her symptomatic improvement to nebs. 

Regarding pt's aspiration and swallowing ability, pt underwent 
video swallow study which confirmed pt's ability to prevent 
aspiration with a strong cough. She was given recommendations 
for tactics to avoid aspiration and PEG tube not recommended. Pt 
was also evaluated by the GI team and underwent repeat dilation 
of esophageal strictures without complication.  

# Thyroid cancer, s/p thyroidectomy and radiation: Pt with 
recurrence in ___.  No evidence of malignancy flair 
contributing to current presentation. She was continued on 
levothyroxine and PET scan will be done as an outpt once 
infectious is resolved.  
CT finding of pulm nodules and vertebral abnormalities can also 
be evaluated by repeat imaging once infection cleared.

# Hypocalcemia: Pt found to be hypocalcemic to 7.8 with ionized 
calcium 1.04. She was repleted with IV calcium as well as 
increased oral calcium and vitamin D. The cause of hypocalcemia 
was unclear. PTH 67, Vit D and Calcitonin pending at time of 
dischrage. 

# Goals of care: Pt expressed exhaustion and frustration with 
ongoing illness and recurrent admissions. She was seen by social 
work and given prn ativan for insomnia. 
Pt's mood improved with resolving symptoms and dyspnea. She was 
assured that there was no current indication for hospice 
approach but that hospice would be discussed should there be any 
change in her disease or prognosis. 

 Pulm nodules and vertebral abnormalities to be evaluated by 
repeat imaging once infection cleared.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with fevers, cough and difficulty swallowing. 
You were found to have a pneumonia which may have been caught in 
the community or a consequence of aspiration while eating. You 
were treated with IV antibiotics and transitioned to oral 
antibiotics which you will need to complete at home. We made 
sure that you had no viral infections such as flu. 

To prevent further infection, you had a video swallowing study 
done by the speech and swallow specialists, who were able to 
provide you with some recommendations on appropriate foods and 
tactics to avoid aspiration. Please crush all of your 
medications and take with food. 

You also were evaluated by Dr ___ team to see if there 
is a dilatable stricture which is causing your current 
aspiration and you were dilated again.

We made the following changes to your medications:
1) Complete another 12 days of antibiotics (Cefpodoxime twice 
daily, and Flagyl three times daily)
2) Increase your calcium intake to three times a day
3) Start using inhalers for symptoms of shortness of breath or 
wheezing

Please call Dr ___ return to the hospital if you develop 
shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, fever ___, 
shaking chills, or any other concerning symptoms. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you, we wish you the best and a 
happy belated birthday!
