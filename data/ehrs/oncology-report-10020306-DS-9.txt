Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
=====================
In brief this is a ___ yo female with hx of breast cancer s/p 
bilateral mastectomy, HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism, type II DM, 
recent left MCA stroke, AF on dabigatran, mixed 
systolic-diastolic CHF (EF 42% on ___, admitted from urgent 
visit for orthostatic hypotension, fatigue, decreased appetite 
and trouble swallowing, became acutely hypotensive on ___ 
secondary to multietiology shock that resolved with addressing 
of underlying etiologies described below. Patient stabilized and 
called out to cardiology service where she underwent diuresis 
with improvement in BNP and mental status. Her course was 
complicated by persistent a fib with RVR for which she was 
placed on digoxin and low dose metoprolol with good response. 
She underwent PEG tube placement due to poor PO intake, though 
she was cleared for pureed foods by the speech team. She was 
discharged to rehab. She may benefit  from cardioversion once on 
anticoagulation for appropriate duration. 

ACUTE PROBLEMS:
===============
# HFrEF (EF 23%)
# Tachymyopathy vs. ischemic cardiomyopathy
Patient presented with poor PO intake/failure to thrive and 
received volume resuscitation. This, in conjunction with 
unidentified newly reduced ejection fraction, likely triggered 
subsequent Afib with RVR. Rate control was attempted with 
metoprolol. This precipitated cardiogenic shock requiring brief 
admission to the MICU. On TTE she was found to have newly 
reduced EF of 23% (compared to prior 42%) with global 
hypokinesis most likely from tachymyopathy due to poorly 
controlled atrial fibrillation prior to this admission. Missed 
ischemic event was considered but cardiac cath was not pursued 
due to frailty. Was trialed on Lasix boluses and subsequently 
bumex gtt prior to transfer from ICU. On transfer to the floor, 
patient was continued on lasix gtt and converted to PO Lasix 
when euvolemic. She was started on digoxin for rate control of 
afib (see below). Afterload reduction was managed with 
captopril. She was eventually tolerating low-dose metoprolol 
after rate control with digoxin. Discharge weight was 136 
pounds. She will follow up with cardiology NP in one week and 
Dr. ___. 

# Atrial fibrillation
First diagnosed in ___ after suffering from stroke. 
CHADSVASC of 8. She was prescribed Diltiazem prior to this 
admission. Upon arrival she was found to have afib with RVR in 
the low 100s and she was volume depleted. With volume repletion 
and uptitration of metoprolol for rate control, she became 
hypotensive. All rate control was held. She was subsequently 
started on digoxin for rate control, and low-dose metoprolol was 
subsequently added and tolerated. Due to intermittent swallowing 
issues/pocketing meds in her mouth, home dabigatran had to be 
converted to apixaban so that she could receive it via her PEG 
tube. During this hospitalization she was considered for 
cardioversion but she had reportedly missed some doses of her 
anticoagulation prior to admission. Going forward, she may 
benefit from cardioversion. She has consistently been 
anticoagulated since ___ (she was on it prior to that but it 
was held briefly for her PEG tube placement). At discharge she 
was still in atrial fibrillation but with heart rates in the 
___. 

# ___
Cr peaked at 2.4 with limited urine output. FeNA suggestive with 
prerenal
etiology, consistent with cardiorenal as driving etiology with 
contribution from ATN from shock described above. Her creatinine 
improved to 0.8 at the time of discharge.

# Coagulopathy
Unclear etiology. liver function seems normal. Vitamin K 
challenge 5 IV x3 days with minimal improvement. 

# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy
# Delirium
Recent stroke, likely acute delirium iso critical illness. CT
head negative. She became quite hypernatremic after starting 
tube feeds, which correlated with her cognitive decline. She 
improved substantially after correction of her serum sodium but 
still remained occasionally disoriented to place/time.

# Failure to thrive
# Concern for dysphagia 
# Weight loss
No clear etiology, as decreased PO intake and weight loss began 
prior to recent stroke. Patient's function and PO intake have 
appeared to continuously worsen since stroke. CT 
abd/pelvis/chest ___ with no e/o malignancy or occult 
infection. Per discussion w/daughter, daughter would like to 
maximize nutrition (including tube feeds) given this is an acute 
decline. The patient was evaluated by the speech and swallow 
time and was cleared for pureed solids and thin liquids. It was 
decided that she could take in whatever desired PO that she 
would like, and that would be supplemental to tube feeding. She 
underwent PEG placement on ___ and was started on bolus tube 
feeds 3x daily. Tube feeds should not be given 2 hours prior to 
AM levothyroxine or two hours after levothyroxine in order to 
allow maximum drug absorption. 

# C diff
Patient developed diarrhea in early ___. C diff stool PCR was 
positive. She completed a 10 day course of PO vancomycin: 
___. She was no longer symptomatic at discharge.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES: 
======================
# OSA
Has diagnosis of severe OSA, on BIPAP at home though compliance
is unclear. She should continue BiPAP at ___ nightly. 

# Left MCA stroke with dysarthria and right hemiparesis on 
___
NCHCT from ___ showed sequela of recent L MCA infarction. No 
evidence of hemorrhagic transformation. She has right sided 
hemiparesis. Continue atorvastatin 40 mg PO daily 

# Type II diabetes mellitus
Restart home metformin and glipizide at discharge. Her blood 
glucose was appropriate on 10 units of Lantus daily, but this 
may require adjustment once she gets on a regular schedule of 
bolus tube feeds.

# Hypothyroidism
Continue home levothyroxine 75 mcg daily. TSH and FT4 were 
checked and were appropriate. Tube feeds should be held two 
hours prior to AM dose and two hours after AM dose to allow 
maximum absorption.

# GERD
Continue pantoprazole 40 mg daily 

# Anemia
She is a ___ Witness and cannot receive blood products. 

# Hypertension
Continue captopril, consider changing to lisinopril 2.5. She did 
not tolerate higher doses of lisinopril in-house and became 
hypotensive.

=========================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=========================
[ ] Discharge weight: 136 pounds
[ ] Discharge diuretic: Lasix 20 mg daily
[ ] Diltiazem was discontinued and should not be restarted due 
to her reduced ejection fraction.
[ ] Dabigatran was switched to apixaban because dabigatran 
cannot be given through PEG tube and she occasionally pockets 
medications in her mouth.
[ ] Consider switching captopril to lisinopril. In the past she 
did not tolerate doses higher than 2.5 mg lisinopril due to 
hypotension.
[ ] Continue to hold tube feeds 2 hours before and 2 hours after 
AM levothyroxine to allow adequate drug absorption.
[ ] Continue bolus dosing of tube feeds 3x daily with PO intake 
as desired. Cleared for pureed solids and thin liquids.
[ ] Consider cardioversion for atrial fibrillation after 
reliable anticoagulation for ___ weeks. She has not missed any 
doses of anticoagulation since ___ after PEG tube placement. 
[ ] Required insulin after initiation of tube feeds. Continue to 
adjust or increase metformin and glipizide to obviate insulin 
altogether. 
[ ] On day of discharge, we learned patient's healthcare proxy 
considered changing code status to DNI, but she was not 
available to confirm this. Please continue goals of care 
discussion and complete MOLST form.
