laparotomy, radical hysterectomy, bilateral

cervical cancer.  Please see operative report for details.  
     The pt was given routine post-op care.  She was kept on her 
home medications for her hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.  
She was not given NSAIDs given her history of renal 
insufficiency (baseline Cr ~2.0) and her foley was kept in for 
one week post-operatively.  The pt continued to require oxygen 
longer than expected post-operatively which was felt to be due 
to her likely undiagnosed chronic lung disease given her 
extensive smoking history as well as a recent URI the pt 
complained of on admission.  She had bilateral lower extremity 
dopplers which did not show evidence of DVT and a CXR did not 
show any evidence of pneumonia but did show atelectasis and 
pleural effusions.  The pt was able to be weaned off the oxygen 
and was discharged home in good condition on POD#3.
