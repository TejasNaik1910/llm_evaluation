CT Abdomen/Pelvis ___: 
Recent placement of a right and left hepatic percutaneous 
transhepatic 
external-internal biliary drains. There is only minimal 
intrahepatic biliary dilation, notably in segments 3, 5 and 8. 
The metallic common bile stent is in the appropriate position. 
There are no liver focal masses to suggest metastasis or cystic 
areas to suggest  organized abscesses or bilomas. No periportal 
or peripancreatic lymphadenopathy. Anasarca, bilateral 
effusions, with dependent fluid in the pelvis.  

TTE ___: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. 
Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate-to-severe 
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular 
systolic function. At least mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Biatrial dilatation. 

TEE ___: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is 
dilated. A patent foramen ovale is present with slight flow 
across the interatrial septum from left to right at rest. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall 
contractility. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and 
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses 
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse 
(P3). No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. 
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid valve prolapse is 
present. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The 
atrial portion of the pacemaker lead is well visualized with no 
associated mass or vegetation. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the 
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No 2D echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. 
Mild mitral valve prolapse with moderate, predominantly 
late-systolic mitral regurgitation. Mild posterior mitral 
leaflet prolapse with moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild 
pulmonary artery hypertension. A PFO is present.  
.
CBD Brushing pathology: ATYPICAL. Atypical ductal cells, 
neutrophils and bile 
Liver biopsy pathology: Liver, needle biopsy (A):
- Scant, extremely distorted tissue with focal atypia, 
insufficient for evaluation.
- Multiple levels have been examined.

.
Choangiography ___
1. Uncomplicated cholangiography with dilatation and stenting of 
hilar 
strictures as above.  
2. It was determined that due to the patient's anatomy, two 
stents would 
likely suffice, one for each lobe.  
3. Of note, the right lobe stent passes through the interstices 
of the 
previously placed common bile duct stent and the left lobe stent 
enters the stent via the distal/upper end, both stents terminate 
in the CBD within the previously placed stent.  
4. Plan to cap the drains when there is no longer blood-tinge to 
the bile and observe with the capped anchor drains. Ultimately, 
we can perform a followup cholangiogram and likely remove the 
anchor drains.

___ CT ABD AND PELVIS
Final Report 
TYPE OF THE EXAM:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis. 
  
REASON FOR THE EXAM AND MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of 
cholangiocarcinoma with 
cholangitis; status post percutaneous transhepatic 
cholangiography with rising 
bilirubin. 
  
COMPARISON EXAM:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis, dated ___.  This 
study was also compared with an angiographic study for a biliary 
catheter 
check on ___. 
  
TECHNIQUE: 
  
Multiple axial MDCT images through the abdomen and pelvis were 
obtained 
post-administration of intravenous contrast and ingestion of 
oral contrast. 
  
LUNG BASES:  There are bilateral pleural effusions, small to 
moderate in size 
with associated atelectasis.  No focal consolidation is seen. 
  
ABDOMEN:  There are two percutaneously placed biliary anchor 
drains.  The 
right catheter appears to have a straighter course compared to 
the prior CT, 
post-revision.  The distal tip of the right catheter is seen 
extending to the 
proximal end of the the metallic common bile duct stent which 
itself extends 
into the right common hepatic duct.  The left-sided catheter is 
seen with 
distal tip just proximal to the left-sided metal stent.  There 
is intermediate 
attenuation material within the drains and stents.  This is 
often noted and 
evaluation for luminal obstruction is limited. 
  
There is mild nonspecific enhancement of the hepatic parenchyma 
surrounding 
the right sided drain, possibly representing post procedural 
changes. Compared 
to the prior study, there is development of a small to moderate 
amount of 
perihepatic, subhepatic ascites and perisplenic ascites.  The 
gallbladder is 
not abnormally distended. There is surrounding fluid.  There is 
small amount 
of fluid in the left paracolic gutter which is slightly 
increased compared to 
the prior study.  There is no significant lymphadenopathy within 
the abdomen 
or pelvis.  The pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands are 
stable.  Kidneys 
enhance homogeneously without abnormalities. 
  
PELVIS:  There is a stable amount of fluid within the pelvis.  
There are 
numerous colonic diverticula.  No evidence of enlarged 
lymphadenopathy within 
the pelvis.  There is minimal stranding along the right-sided 
colon which 
probably is in the setting of anasarca. 
  
Osseous structures are stable without evidence of worrisome 
blastic or lytic 
lesions or acute fractures. 
  
VASCULAR STRUCTURES:  Atherosclerotic plaques of the aorta and 
iliac vessels 
are noted.  There is no aneurysmal dilatation or dissection. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  Compared to the prior CT of ___, there has been 
repositioning 
of the PTB drains which are now externalized. There is 
relatively stable 
central intrahepatic biliary dilatation. 
  
2.  Increased small amount of intra-abdominal ascites. 
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with cholangiocarcinoma who was admitted with 
cholangitis and septicemia to OSH, transferred here for 
management of biliary obstruction.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Cholangitis with biliary obstruction, complicated by 
enterococcal and E coli septicemia.  
She presented to OSH with sepsis on ___.  Found to have E coli 
and enterococcus in her blood from biliary source.  She was 
treated with Unasyn given the sensitivities.  She was 
transferred to ___ on ___ and underwent ERCP but her bile duct 
was unable to be cannulated due to visible tumor.  She therefore 
underwent PTC/PTBD on ___ without complication.  
She was seen by the infectious disease team and had TEE, 
negative for endocarditis or pacemaker wire infection.  She also 
had a CT abdomen/pelvis to rule out liver abscesses given a 
possible lesion seen during PTBD, but CT did not demonstrate any 
complications of her cholangitis.  Surveillance blood cx were 
negative.  
Her biliary drains were capped on ___. Had repeat cholangiogram 
___ which looked ok. Over next few days bilirubin rose, so 
cholangiogram again done ___, showing patent stents; reason for 
higher bili remains unclear. Drains are capped and clinically 
she looks well.  Drains were uncapped on ___ with slight 
improvement in bilirubin.  Repeat CT ABD ___ showed stable 
ductal dilation.   She underwent repeat cholangiogram with 
removal of one drain and adjustment of the other drain.  The 
drain was capped and she had stable but elevated bilirubin to 
approx 4 on discharge but no pain or fever.  ___ plans to have 
her return in ___ weeks for drain removal.  She received 
instructions on how to place drain to bag if she develops pain 
or fever.  She stopped unasyn on ___.  She will be on oral 
fluconazole until ___.  

# Cholangiocarcinoma: She has unresectable cholangiocarcinoma 
s/p palliative chemo/XRT.  Patient and husband had been under 
the impression that her cancer was "cured" by the chemo - 
however, tumor seen on ERCP as above (though path and cytology 
nondiagnostic).  Oncologist is Dr ___ at ___ in ___ - 
updated by fax on ___. 
I spoke with her oncologist, Dr. ___ at ___ in ___ to 
update him about clinical course, dx of biliary interventions 
and use of PTBD and antibiotics for her cholangitis, septicemia. 
 
-She will need close follow-up with her oncologist as her 
biliary obstruction is likely due to her cholangiocarcinoma.

# Afib. Had RVR on admission to OSH, rate ctrl'd well here 
without issue. Continued on digoxin + metoprolol (home meds). 
Coumadin was held given multiple above procedures, and not 
bridged with heparin.  
-Planned to restart coumadin at discharge once plan in place for 
drains. 

INACTIVE ISSUES:

# HTN: Controlled on metoprolol.

# ? Dementia: She was transferred from the OSH on Aricept 
although per her PCP, this is not a home medication for her.  
This was stopped during this admission and she should see her 
PCP to address this issue.
 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.  You were 
admitted to the hospital due to an obstruction and infection in 
your bile ducts that spread to your blood.  You underwent a 
procedure called an ERCP but the infection needed to be drained 
through your skin (percutaneously) therefore drains were placed 
by the interventional radiologists.  
The infection and obstruction was most likely caused by your 
cancer (cholangiocarcinoma).  You were treated with antibiotics 
and drains were placed to releive back up of bile.  

Your coumadin was held for the procedures. When you leave the 
hospital you should resume it on ___ evening.
