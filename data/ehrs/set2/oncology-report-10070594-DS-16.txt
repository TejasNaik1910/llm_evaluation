Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of 
metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of unknown origin on ___ 
who presented with fatigue and failure to thrive, recovered with 
diuresis and ___ who received port placement and initiation of 
chemotherapy C2 with carboplatin/etoposide prior to transfer of 
care to ___ in ___.

# UTI:
# Fatigue/Failure to Thrive: The patient was admitted with 
failure to thrive and fatigue, unable to rise from bed on his 
own prior to admission. He was found to have positive U/A, for 
which he was treated empirically with ceftriaxone. Once 
speciation and sensitivity resulted, the patient's course was 
completed with ciprofloxacin, a total of 7d abx. He was able to 
work with ___ and with given symptomatic therapy for edema and 
improved nutrition after which he was able to self-mobilize 
sufficiently to be cleared for a home discharge. He received a 
port and his C2 carboplatin/etoposide, and is scheduled to 
establish care with ___ closer to his home in ___.

# Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumor: Metastatic to lymph nodes and 
liver. Treating with palliative intent with carboplatin and 
etoposide complicated by pancytopenia. The patient received a 
port while inpatient (apixaban was held then restarted) and his 
chemotherapy C2 carboplatin/etoposide was administered. He was 
discharged to be seen at ___ in ___ where he will be set 
up with Neupogen.

# Right Upper Extremity PICC-Associated DVT:
# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was on apixaban for both 
PICC-associated DVT as well as AFib, and has malignancy not felt 
to require Lovenox. His apixaban was held for 48 hours prior 
place port, then resumed 24 hours post port placement per ___. No 
bleeding complications from port placement. Home metoprolol was 
continued.

# Gout: Continued home allopurinol.

# Lower Extremity Edema: Likely multifactorial including 
malnutrition/hypoalbuminemia and inactivity. The patient's home 
Lasix 40mg PO daily was continued and TEDS were used to good 
effect in symptom control. The patient was active with ___ during 
his stay and all therapies together reduced his overall edema.

# Chronic Diarrhea: Likely from his neuro-endocrine tumor. Labs 
checked on admission and C. Diff negative. The patient had been 
using loperamide at home to good effect and this was continued 
during admission once infectious etiology ruled out.

# Severe Protein-Calorie Malnutrition: Very poor intake and 
weight loss. Albumin 2.3 on admission. Nutrition was 
supplemented during admission with nutrition consultation. 
Discharged on multivitamin.

# Anemia: Stable throughout admission without evidence of active 
bleeding. Likely due to inflammatory block from malignancy as 
well as possible marrow involvement. No indication for 
transfusion during stay.

# NASH-Induced Cirrhosis:
# Ascites: Patient felt to have synthetic dysfunction as a 
result of NASH cirrhosis or potential hepatic infiltration of 
NET. Malnutrition felt to be contributing to ascites and edema. 
Patient was given vitamin K 5mg PO x 2 and had improvement in 
coags including INR<1.5. Patient tolerated port placement 
without adverse bleeding outcome.

# BPH: Continued home doxazosin and finasteride during 
admission.

# Prediabetes Mellitus: Patient not placed on sliding scale, did 
not require any, and had serum glucose within normal range 
during admission.

# CKD Stage II-IIIA: Cr at baseline throughout admission, 
medications renally dosed during admission.

# Lower Extremity Neuropathy: Likely secondary to Carboplatin, 
unchanged during admission.

# Bell's Palsy Left Side: Known prior to admission, monitored 
and unchanged during admission.
