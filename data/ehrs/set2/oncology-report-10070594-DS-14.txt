History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ man with metastatic neurodendocrine 
tumor,
unknown primary, who is admitted from the ED with a sycnopal
episode.

Patient has had progressive functional decline over the last
several months with associated poor po intake. He denies nausea
or frank abdominal pain, but does note bloating and significant
dysgeusia. He reports having eaten 'very little' over the
previous month. Additionally, he has developed large volume
diarrhea over the last three weeks, up to ___ stools per day
(worse at night). He has also had increasing weakness over this
time. 

His son brought him to his medical oncology clinic on day of
admission, but he had a syncopal episode in the parking lot.
Patient stood up out of the car, and felt light headed. He did
not fall right away, but eventually his legs 'gave out'. His son
caught him and lowered him to the ground. He had no LOC, no
headstrike, and he remembers the event clearly. No preceeding 
CP,
palpitations or SOB. Does have occaisional word finding
difficulty, but no other new neurologic issues. He was seen in
oncology where he was noted to have soft BP's (90/59), was 
unable
to stand up, have word finding difficulties, and slight left
facial droop. He was transported to the ED.

In the ED, initial VS were: pain 0, T 97.2, HR 86, BP 108/74, RR
16, O2 100%RA. Labs notable for Na 140, K 3.8, HCO3 20, Cr 1.2,
ALT 22, AST 54, ALP 348, LDH 467, TBIli 1.8, Alb 3.3, WBC 7.6,
HCT 36.6, PLT 245, INR 1.9, Uric acid 16.7.

CXR showed possible subtle right lateral mid lung consolidation.
CT head showed new bilateral hygroma - neurosurgery recommended
no intervention. Liver US showed known metastatic disease, but 
no
biliary obstruction. Patient received 1LNS prior to admission.

On arrival to the floor, patient reports feeling better than he
has in several weeks. No recent fevers or chills. He does have
significant dry mouth and food tastes 'awful'. No CP or SOB. No
palpitations. No N/V. No frank abdominal pain, but does have
bloating. No dysuria. No new leg pain or weakness. No 
significant
flushing. No new rashes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
A complete 10-point review of systems was performed and was
negative unless otherwise noted in the HPI.

consolidation.  No focal consolidation seen elsewhere.  Mild
cardiomegaly.  No pulmonary edema. 

___ Imaging LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US 
1. Enlarged heterogeneous liver parenchyma containing several
heterogeneous masses including a 11 x 8 cm right liver lobe 
mass,
better assessed on of ___ CT abdomen pelvis.  Patent
main portal vein with hepatopetal flow. 
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis. 

___ Imaging CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 
- Bilateral hygromas versus chronic subdural hematomas without
significant midline shift. 
- No acute intracranial hemorrhage. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
___ is a ___ man with metastatic neurodendocrine 
tumor, unknown primary, who is admitted from the ED with a 
syncopal episode.

# Syncope: Not clear he had a true syncopal episode, but most 
likely collapsed in parking lot getting out of the car in 
setting of orthostatic hypotension and
hypovolemia as he was subsequently on evaluation found to by 
hypotensive with BP in ___. He has been having ongoing diarrhea 
for several weeks now, see below. Head CT showed concern for 
chronic subdural vs hygroma, unlikely that this would account 
for his symptoms. per NSGY this is not subdural and discussed w/ 
the NP from their service likely chronic hygroma and no need for 
further imaging
and if anticoag needed that would be find from their standpoint. 
Pt was likely hypovolemic from ongoing diarrhea and very poor po 
intake. Doubt infectious process contributing, CXR without 
obvious infiltrate. See below for asymptomatic bacteruria. No 
leukocytosis or fever (developed elevated WBC after dex with 
chemotherapy). Doubt PE given was on anticoag at baseline. 
Cultures negative to date (see below for asx bacteruria) so DCd 
antibiotics early in course and pt continued to do quite well.

# Afib/RVR - HR was up to ___ in setting of initially 
holding his metop/verapamil on admit due to syncope. He is 
asymptomatic. He has no prior CVA history. Uptitrated metop to 
50mg q6 with excellent effect. Given hypotension/syncope on 
admit, will DC pt on metop 200mg XL (was on 100mg XL at home - 
but also with verapamil) and DC his verapamil as HR well 
controlled this admit on 50mg metop q6 and off verapamil, and 
possibly verapamil with more antihypertensive
effect contributing to orthostasis. Was continued on apixaban 
given need for full anticoagulation due to RUE PICC associated 
DVT.

# Elevated cardiac enzymes - mild, downtrended. per discussion 
w/ cardiology, most likely from demand in setting of 
hypovolemia. Pt has no history of prior MI. He has no chest pain 
and serial EKGs have had no dynamic changes (mild ST dep in 
lateral leads <1mm, stable, no e/o Q waves). Per discussion w/ 
cardiology, catheterization not indicated as wouldn't be 
candidate for dual platelet therapy most likely as anticipate 
thrombocytopenia in which case pt would be unable to come off of 
ASA/Plavix, posing significant challenges. TTE for baseline, but 
wouldn't likely be a surgical candidate even if significant 
valvular disease (showed mod MR, normal EF)
Trended trops to peak (0.04). Cont metop on DC at higher dose. 
Could initiate statin but will consider any interactions there 
with chemotherapy. Per oncologist hold off on starting statin at 
this time given chemo and drug interactions.

# Hyperbilirubinemia: 
# Hyperuricemia:
Improved with chemo. Elevated bilirubin initially concerning for 
biliary obstruction, but RUQ showed no obvious obstruction. 
Given elevated uric acid, must also consider tumor lysis. 
Fortunately, his creatinine is at recent baseline and he has no 
gross electrolyte abnormalities. This may represent significant 
tumor
burden turnover due to his large liver mass. He may have 
elevated uric acid at baseline given his historical problems 
with gout (none current). no e/o hemolysis on labs. ___ was 
hydrated initially as above. Initiated allopurinol. 

# Hygroma: Unclear significance. ___ be due to dehydration or 
possibly chronic subdural hematoma. No clear acute insult, and 
no history of falls outside of today's episode. Pt reports 
getting struck in the head as a child though unclear if related
Per neurosurgery NTD at this point. Holding anticoagulation 
given concerns re anemia/anticpated thrombocytopenia, though 
from ___ standpoint ok to continue if needed from hygroma 
standpoint.

# Diarrhea: Likely from his neuro-endocrine tumor. Stool 
cultures sent in ED and C.diff neg. Per pt improving over the 
course of the admission, using immodium prn.

# Asymptomatic bacteruria - Ucx on admit grew citrobacter, but 
pt denied fever or leukocytosis, was not neutropenic, and 
continued to deny any urinary symptoms. He does at baseline have 
difficulty that when he urinates stool comes out along with it 
(pelvic muscle control issues?) but given this reflects 
asymptomatic bacteruria, held off on treating for now. 

# Protein calorie malnutrition. Nutrition consulted. Recommended 
supplements.

# Neuroendocrine tumor: Metastatic to lymph nodes and presumably 
the liver.  Unclear primary source.  Based on cytology appears 
to be well differentiated high grade. Plan has been to start 
carboplatin/etoposide pending syncope workup and
hyperbilirubinemia, which was given D1 on ___. PICC for 
access/chemo. Dr. ___ to arrange for outpatient port 
placement before next cycle. arranging for neulasta ___ 
appointment on ___ ___. Repeated liver biopsy ___ to 
rule out HCC and compare to neuroendocrine path from lymph node. 
Received D1-D3 of C1 Carboplatin/Etoposide while in-house. 

# Right arm swelling - picc in place, ultrasound showed PICC 
associated DVT. Patient was restarted on apixaban, PICC was 
pulled on ___.

# Anemia - stable.  likely inflammatory block and from 
malignancy, he may have marrow involvement. Drop initially 
likely hemodilutional as pt hemoconcentrated on admit. checked 
hemolysis labs (hapto 151, Tbili downtrending reassuring).

# NASH-induced cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension.
# Ascites  
E/o volume overload after chemo and initial hydration. Got 20mg 
IV Lasix on ___ w some improvement on exam though weight 
stable. Resumed home 20mg Lasix daily subsequently.

# Hypertension - borderline BPs in low 100s initially but 
normotensive upon discharge
- Dose increased metoprolol, as above, and cont holding 
verapamil. Decreased doxazosin dose.

# BPH: Dose reduced home doxazosin, continued finasteride

# Gout: Initiated allopurinol, continue colchicine as needed

# Prediabetes mellitus: On LSS/Fingersticks while in house

# CKD: Stage IIIA. At most recent baseline

# Bell's palsy left side: Known prior to admission

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted after fainting. We felt you were dehydrated. 
You also received chemotherapy and had a liver biopsy.

We think some of your blood pressure medicines caused low blood 
pressure in setting of dehydration and contributed to the 
fainting. We changed these around. Please STOP your verapamil. 
We increased the dose of your metoprolol instead. Also, we 
decreased the dose of your doxazosin as this can cause low blood 
pressure. We are discharging you on apixaban mostly due to your 
blood clot in the right arm. If your platelets drop 
significantly with your chemotherapy your oncologist may ask you 
to stop the apixaban for a moment. 

Call your oncologist if any signs of bleeding. 

You need to get your neulasta injection on ___, see below.

We are sending you home with home ___ services.

Your ___ Team
 
Followup Instructions:
