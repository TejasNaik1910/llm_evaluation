Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
new metastatic lesions
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ guided lung biopsy
 
History of Present Illness:
___ PMH HCC (s/p liver resection + RFA) as well as colon cancer
(s/p resection + adjuvant FOLFOX), presents today with new
metastatic lesions on imaging + acute PE

As per review of ___ clinic notes, pt last seen in ___
when he was felt to be in remission for colon cancer but AFP was
rising. Subsequent CT ___ was without evidence of new or
recurrent disease. On ___ patient had Colonoscopy without 
any
e/o malignancy. Today, patient had CT scans which revealed new
liver lesions which appeared more c/w colorectal metastases, and
was also found to have apply core lesion in neo-sigmoid colon 
c/f
malignancy. CT chest revealed RLL PE, numerous b/l lung nodules
c/w metastatic disease, as well as new thyroid nodules. In light
of new malignant lesions, patient referred to ED by outpatient
oncologist for expedited w/u including biopsy to determine if
lesions are due to HCC or colon cancer recurrence. 
 
Pt reports that he has some shortness of breath, but is without
any chest pain or pleurisy.  He noted that he feels wheezy,
denied any cough, fever or chills.  He noted that he has
intermittent constipation and is only been passing small bowel
movements which she is concerned about.  Noted that he is
tolerating oral intake and is voiding without difficulty.  He
noted that he is concerned about the cancerous lesions and is
hopeful that there is a treatment

CT A/P
IMPRESSION: 
1. New OPTN 5 B lesions in segment II, V and VI.
2. A new enhancing mass in segment VI is not hyperenhancing on 
the arterial
phase, and maintains persistent enhancement, with an appearance 
more
characteristic of colorectal metastasis than hepatocellular 
carcinoma by
imaging.
3. Re-demonstrated treatment cavities in segment VII and VIII, 
without
evidence of local recurrence.  Treatment cavity in segment VI is
re-demonstrated, with some enhancement but no definite washout 
and overall the
appearance is similar to prior.  Continued attention on 
follow-up is
recommended.
4. Nonocclusive thrombosis in the left portal vein.
5. Stable splenomegaly, with new moderate volume ascites.
6. New 2 cm long apple-core lesion in the neo sigmoid colon is 
concerning for
malignancy.  Recommend correlation with direct visualization.
7. Please refer to the separately dictated CT chest report from 
the same date
for a description of thoracic findings.

Chest CT
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary arterial filling 
defects compatible
with recent pulmonary emboli, new since the prior study.
2. Numerous bilateral lung nodules, new since, are likely 
metastases.
3. Bilateral hypodense nodules in the thyroid measure up to 1.3 
cm on the
right.  Further evaluation with thyroid ultrasound is 
recommended if
clinically appropriate.
4. Please see separately submitted Abdomen and Pelvis CT report 
for
subdiaphragmatic findings.

CT head
IMPRESSION: 
No acute intracranial process.  Mild small vessel disease.  No 
definite
evidence for intracranial metastasis.  There is further concern, 
an MRI may be
performed to further assess.

Colonoscopy
-Colonic mucosa appeared normal. Prep was fair. The sigmoid 
colon was thoroughly evaluated with the therapeutic EGD scope 
and then with a standard EGD scope. No mass was seen. A 
circumferentially thickened fold was seen in the distal sigmoid 
at the site of the anastomosis but otherwise appeared normal. 
The anastomosis was seen on tretroflexion and appeared normal. 
The thickened sigmoid fold possibly may have caused the CT 
findings. The lumen was not obstructing and was widely patent 
and hence a colonic stent was not placed/indicated
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMH HCC (s/p liver resection + RFA) as well as colon cancer
(s/p resection + adjuvant FOLFOX), presents today with new
metastatic lesions on imaging + acute PE. Also with significant
obstructive bowel sx s/p ___. He was started on heparin 
drip for PE. ___ guided biopsy of lung was performed and results 
pending. He underwent ___ which did not show an obstructive 
lesion, after which his obstructive bowel symptoms improved. He 
is resumed on lovenox for PE and is stable for discharge with 
onc follow up.
