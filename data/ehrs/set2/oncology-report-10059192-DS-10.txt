History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with the past medical history 
of stage III colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and adjuvant chemo 
in ___, who presents from ___ with complicated 
diverticulitis.  

She initially presented to ___ yesterday on ___ with 
increased weakness, lightheadedness and "feeling sick" with poor 
appetite over the past 1 week.  She denies any f/c/s, abd pain, 
n/v.  She has had intermittent diarrhea (chronic for her), for 
which she has been taking Imodium.  Last BM on ___, no BRBPR 
or melena. She has also noted an unintentional weight loss of
___ lbs over the last one year and attributes that to "I just 
don't eat, I don't bother with it".  She denies dysphagia, 
odynophagia, early satiety. Over the past week she reports 
increased weakness and lightheadedness.  She denies urinary 
complaints.  She has not suffered any recent falls, but 
presented
yesterday due to presyncopal symptoms.  Of note, she reports a 
prior severe episode of diverticulitis ___ year ago, requiring 
antibiotics but no admission per patient.    

In the ___ to have profound hypokalemia to 2.3. She was 
given both IV and PO repletion.  CXR and head CT were negative 
for acute processes.  She was admitted to the medical service. 

During her brief admission, she was noted to have diffuse 
abdominal tenderness, prompting a CT scan of the abdomen which 
revealed diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon with multiple 
abscesses. She was started on zosyn, IVF, and kept NPO.  Surgery 
was consulted and recommended transfer to ___ given patient's
underlying colon CA history and prior surgery.  At ___, due 
to family concerns of patient being more confused, she had a 
head CT and MRI which demonstrated no acute changes except for 
moderate hippocampal atrophy. 

Currently, she is resting comfortably but frustrated with 
feeling weak.  She reports the ride in the ambulance caused some 
abdominal discomfort due to the bouncing, but has no abd pain 
now.  No other new symptoms.

IMAGING AND OTHER STUDIES
CT Abd/Pelvis ___
There is acute sigmoid diverticulitis with multiple loculated 
fluid collections suggestive of abscesses located within the 
pelvis. Based on the position of the collections and the number 
of separate collections, the findings are not amenable to 
percutaneous drainage.

MRI Head ___
1. No acute abnormality identified.
2. Moderate hippocampal atrophy.
3. Fluid in the left middle ear could indicate otitis media.

CXR ___
The lungs are clear. The heart is normal in size. 
Atherosclerotic changes seen in the thoracic aorta. Mild 
spondylosis seen in the thoracic spine.

Head CT ___
No acute abnormality.

___ guided drain ___
Limited preprocedure CT of the pelvis with contrast demonstrates 
multiple loculated fluid collections within the pelvis, similar 
to recent outside CT abdomen and pelvis.  The largest rim 
enhancing collection containing air and measuring approximately 
4.2 x 3.2 cm slightly to the right of the midline was targeted 
for drain placement.  Approximately 13 cc of purulent fluid was  
drained. Additionally there is more free flowing fluid within 
the bilateral pelvis.  Approximately 10 cc of clear yellow 
ascites was aspirated from the right pelvic free fluid.  
1. Successful CT-guided placement of an ___ pigtail 
catheter into the rim enhancing pelvic collection containing 
air. Approximately 13 cc of purulent fluid was drained. Samples 
were sent for microbiology evaluation. As this appeared frankly 
purulent, sample was not submitted for cytology. 
2. Additionally, a sample of loculated right pelvic free fluid 
was aspirated, and appeared to be simple ascites.  This was sent 
for microbiology.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with prior colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy and chemotherapy 
(currently ___, GERD, diarrhea and hypokalemia, who presented 
with weakness/gait instability, weight loss, ___ and was found 
to have acute complicated diverticulitis with intra-abdominal 
fluid collections suspicious for abscesses. Now s/p ___ drain 
placement with frank pus expressed from one of the collections.

She was admitted from ___, and treated with IV antibiotics, 
bowel rest, IVF. She was seen by CRS and ___, and taken for drain 
placement into the accessible fluid collection. Frank pus was 
obtained and sent for microbiology. After this procedure her 
diet was advanced successfully. Cipro/flagyl were transitioned 
to PO after diet advancement. She had some diarrhea (C diff 
negative) and this was managed with Imodium. The CRS service 
recommended discharge with drain management and followup in 
their clinic in 2 weeks for further treatment planning.

# Complicated diverticulitis with abscess: CRS also querying GYN 
malignancy. She has improved with rehydration, cipro/flagyl, and 
bowel rest. CRS recommended attempt at ___ guided drainage, which 
was done yesterday, with frank pus aspirated; drain was placed 
and is currently in situ. There are unfortunately multiple 
collections which are loculated and do not communicate with this 
collection that is currently draining. I have spoken at length 
with ___ team, and they report that she will likely need OR for 
sigmoid resection, and that the goal at this point is 
antibiotics, drainae of drainable collections, and time for 
inflammation to improve prior to surgery. 
- CRS would like to see her in 2 weeks in ___ clinic on 
antibiotics, at which plan for antibiotics, drain, interval 
imaging, and OR can be finalized
- Continue cipro/flagyl until ___ visit
- Continue drain + drain management
- F/u finalized abscess fluid culture (and ascites culture)
- Continue regular diet with supplements

# History of chronic diarrhea
# Diarrhea here: Worsening diarrhea reported by patient after 
advancing her diet, likely in setting of advancing diet, 
antibiotics, known diverticulitis, and chronic diarrhea. C diff 
sent and negative.
- Titrate antidiarrheal medications for control of diarrhea

# Weakness
# Gait instability: Acute on chronic/slowly progressive by 
history. Subjective improvement with rehydration, treatment of 
above infection. Seen by ___, who recommended rehab.

# Weight loss, decreased appetite
# Moderate malnutrition: Likely due to infection as above. Same 
query re: malignancy as below.

# Social issues: She is having issues with housing, feels like 
she can't go back to her ALF. Her HCP is an EMT and lives 
outside of the state. Her daughter is not her HCP but does live 
somewhat nearby. She met with social work. Her daughter and 
granddaughter have started to make plans for caring for her in 
their own homes after discharge from rehab. Ultimately, she 
would like to move to ___ to be with her 
granddaughter and great-grandchildren.

# ___
# Hypokalemia: On presentation, improved with rehydration.

# GERD: Stable. She was not continued on home PPI and had no 
symptoms, so this medication was discontinued at discharge.

# Small ascites identified on CT: Likely sympathetic in setting 
of complicated diverticulitis. Sample was sent for microbiology 
but not cytology or cell counts/ fluid studies.
- F/u ascites fluid culture

# Question of GYN malignancy: In review of imaging, Dr ___ 
___ some concern for underlying gynecologic malignancy as 
source of these collections. Given finding of frank pus, I would 
suppose the suspicion is now much lower for this. She would
require followup imaging to ensure resolution of these 
collections anyway, and may well end up going to OR, at which 
point her GYN organs can be reassessed. Notably, she denies 
vaginal bleeding or discharge.
- Could consider pelvic MRI for further characterization of 
pelvic organs

# Question of otitis on imaging: She denies any symptoms of left 
otitis media (as seen on MRI). She was recently treated and is 
being treated with ciprofloxacin, which should provide 
reasonable treatment for any bacterial otitis.

# Question of prolonged QT on EKG at ___. Repeat EKG ___ 
two hours after ciprofloxacin and sertraline showed U waves, QT 
was WNL.

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued on home statin.

# Anxiety/depression: Continued on home sertraline. 

Code status: She was full code here

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with weakness and weight loss. You were found 
to have acute diverticulitis with multiple fluid 
collections/abscesses. You were treated with IV fluids, 
antibiotics, and bowel rest and you improved. A drain was placed 
in one of the larger and more accessible fluid collections, 
which showed pus consistent with an abscess. You were seen by 
the colorectal surgery service and they recommended antibiotics, 
drainage, and followup in their clinic in 2 weeks in order to 
determine a plan, which may include repeat imaging or surgery.

You are being discharged to rehab with the drain and with 
antibiotics. You will need to follow up closely with the 
colorectal surgery service. They are planning to see you in 
outpatient clinic in 2 weeks; their number is below.
