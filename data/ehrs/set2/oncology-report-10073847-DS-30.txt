Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with DLBCL and CNS relapse, CAD/CHF, and upper

MTX not given due to progression on MRI.  Given ICE instead.
.
# DLBCL/CNS relapse: MRI spine ___, done for worsening 
back/leg pain, showed progression.  Neuro-oncology and Radiation 
Oncology consulted.  XRT would eliminate methotrexate as a 
future option and risk of XRT-toxicity increased due to recent 
methotrexate.  Given salvage ICE cycle #1: Ifosfamide 5000mg/m2 
Day #2, carboplatin AUC 5 (capped at 800mg) Day #2, etoposide 
100mg/m2 Days ___.  Mesna and IV fluids to prevent hemorrhagic 
cystitis.  Tolerated well.  Plan for G-CSF 480mcg SC daily 
starting ___ after chemo finished.  Lumbar puncture by 
Interventional Radiology under fluoroscopy unsuccessful 
(possibly obstructed by tumor).  Held enoxaparin for this 
procedure.  Increased dexamethasone to 4mg q8HR due to increased 
back/leg pain.

Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
1. Cycle #1 ICE chemotherapy.
2. Relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
3. Back pain.
 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).
 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for cycle #6 high-dose 
methotrexate chemotherapy for relapsed diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma.  However, methotrexate was not given because of a 
spine MRI showing progression of disease.  This is the cause of 
your worsening back pain.  Instead, after evaluation by 
Neuro-Oncology and Radiation Oncology, you received ICE 
chemotherapy.  Your pain was controlled by increasing 
dexamethasone and OxyContin doses.  A lumbar puncture, first 
done on the floor unsuccessfully, was later done by Radiology.
.
MEDICATION CHANGES:
1. Dexamethasone increased to 4mg every 6 hours.
2. OxyContin increased to 80mg 3x a day.
3. Take G-CSF (Neupogen) 480mcg subcutaneous injection daily 
starting ___ and finishing on ___.
