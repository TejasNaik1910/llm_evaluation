History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with pancreatic cancer
metastatic to the liver (dx ___, MS stable, KRAS mutation)
with progression on modified FOLFIRINOX, admitted from ___
clinic on ___ for fevers up to 102.2 F, nonbilious emesis x 1,
and acute urinary retention. He had been on bridge chemotherapy
with erlotinib (since ___ and was scheduled for C1D1 of
gemcitabine on ___, but this was held in the setting of his new
symptoms. The patient said he had been feeling well until about
two weeks ago, when he began developing increased bloating and
poor appetite. Then about ___ days PTA, he started to have low
grade temperatures around ___ F and felt intermittently
nauseous. During the clinic visit on ___, he had an episode of
voluminous vomiting of partially undigested food from breakfast
at least three hours prior.  Stated that he felt very fatigued
and out of sorts.  No abdominal pain, fevers, chills or night
sweats. 

In clinic, his vital signs were: BP 161/55, T 99.4 (up to 102.2)
with HR ___, RR 16, and SaO2 100% on RA. His exam was notable 
for
oropharyngeal thrush, trace edema of the lower extremities, and
skin desquamation on the bottom of his feet without any evidence
of skin breakdown. His labs in clinic were significant for WBC
12.2, H/H 9.8/12.2, Na 126, ALT/AST ___ with tbili 1.6 alk 
phos
855. He had an elevated lactate of 3.7. Notably, his CEA was 
47.4
(up from prior) and ___ ___ ___ (up from ___ on ___. 
He
was given 1L IVF, zofran, nystatin, and tylenol, and blood and
urine cultures were obtained. Dr. ___ spoke with Dr. ___ with plan for MRCP with consideration of further
endoscopic intervention with percutaneous drainage to relieve
possible gastric outlet obstruction. In clinic, patient was also
found to have poor UOP with only 60cc voided post-IVF
resuscitation and bladder scan revealing > 500cc retained urine.
Post void bladder scan showed 458cc in the bladder with plan for
further management of his hyperbilirubinemia, fevers, n/v, and
acute urinary retention on OMED.  

Overnight, patient was started on IV cefepime/flagyl and 
received
1L IVF and zofran for nausea.  Additional blood cultures were
obtained and a CXR showed no evidence of any acute 
intrapulmonary
process and KUB was negative for SBO.  Labs were notable for a 
Na
125, BUN/Cr ___, HCO3 21, lactate 3.7, ALT/AST 53/88, AP 762,
Tbili 1.9, Dbili 1.4, WBC 11.5, and H/H 9.3/27.8. He became
hypoglycemic with FSBG 56 at 0200 and was given 12.5 gm D50 IV x
1 and started on D5LR @ 125 cc/hr.  On recheck, his FSBG was 
132.
A RUQ ultrasound was ordered and pending at the time of
evaluation.
 
Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Mr. ___ was diagnosed pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to
the liver in ___ when he was admitted for painless
jaundice. CT showed 3.3cm pancreatic head mass and MRI
showed a 1.8cm left kidney lesion concerning for RCC as well as 
2
sub-cm liver masses. FNA of pancreas showed 'suspicious' cells.
His pancreatic mass was deemed unresectable due to abutting the
SMV and portal vein. He was treated with three cycles of
FOLFIRINOX ___ which was halted due to rising CA 
___
and increased size of liver metastases. In ___,  CA
___ elevated to 23K and considered potentially related to left
finger infection in setting of diabetes. Imaging shows increased
size of liver metastases. In ___ he started
gemcitabine/Abraxane. Imaging ___ showing slight decrease 
in
the size of the liver metastases with stable disease at the
pancreas. Course complicated by right thigh muscle infarct
presumed ___ diabetes in ___. Primary chemotherapy side
effect has been neuropathy on the bottoms of b/l feet without
impairment of ADLs. Has required multiple dose and schedule
adjustments in order to maximize quality of life, minimize 
marrow
toxicity and maintain control over tumor (primarily assessed by
tumor marker). Imaging has showed mixed response in early ___:
given discordance with ___, unclear if true progression vs
variations due to reduced chemotherapy exposure at various time
points for various toxicity and scheduling reasons. In setting 
of
increasing side effects and  mixed response by imaging/markers,
changed to CapOx on ___ scans show a mixed response to treatment, regimen
changed to modified FOLFIRINOX 
-___: Began modified FOLFIRINOX with dose reduction ___
IVP and Leucovorin held from regimen) (Per OMR, patient
previously given this regimine at ___ for 3 cycles ___ ago)
-___: CT scan showed progression of disease with an interval

ERCP ___: 
Major Papilla: A previously placed metal stent and plastic 
stents were found in the major papilla. There was evidence of 
distal migration, though the majority of the stent remained 
within the CBD. There was evidence of significant debris 
surrounding and within the lumen of the stent.   

Cannulation:  Given significant duodenal narrowing and 
distortion we were unable to get the therapeutic duodenoscope 
into an appropriate position. Thus, we switched to a diagnostic 
duodenoscope and cannulated the bile duct in a long position. 
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a 
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Small amount of 
contrast medium was injected resulting in complete 
opacification. The procedure was moderately difficult   
 
Biliary Tree: The common bile duct, was filled with contrast and 
well visualized. There was no evidence of obvious filling 
defects within the level of the stent and above it. I supervised 
the acquisition and interpretation of the fluoroscopic images. 
The quality of the fluoroscopic images was good   

Procedures: A plastic stent was removed from the main duct.
The sphincterotome was exchanged for an extraction balloon 
catheter. Balloon sweeps were perfromed and yielded small amount 
of sludge. Further sweeps were performed until no debris was 
noted.

RUQ ultrasound ___:
1. Mild peripheral biliary ductal dilation, most predominantly 
seen in the left hepatic dome.  No significant central biliary 
ductal dilation.
2. Numerous hepatic metastasis, please refer to recent MRI for 
more detailed description.
3. Mild splenomegaly.
4. Redemonstration of a pancreatic neoplasm measuring 1.7 x 3.9 
cm, again for more detailed description please correlate with 
recent MRI.

KUB ___:
No evidence of small-bowel obstruction.

CXR ___:
Comparison to ___.  No relevant change is noted.  
Signs of mild overinflation.  No evidence of pneumonia.  No 
pulmonary edema, no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Normal 
size of the heart.  The right pectoral Port-A-Cath is in stable 
correct position.

MRI Liver ___:
Progression of disease with an interval increase in size of the 
innumerable hepatic masses, increased abnormal soft tissue in 
the retroperitoneum, and increasing ascites.  Additionally, the 
primary pancreatic cancer in the pancreatic head is very 
minimally increased in size.

CT CHEST w/ CON ___:
New irregular nodule in the right upper lobe and interval 
increase of the right lower lobe nodules concerning for 
progressive metastatic disease. 

ERCP ___:
EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at ___ MHz 
frequency 
The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from the duodenal 
bulb and the second / third duodenum.  
The body and tail were imaged from the gastric body and fundus. 

Mass: A 3.5 cm X 4 cm ill-defined mass was noted in the head of 
the pancreas.  
The mass was hypoechoic and heterogenous in echotexture.  
The borders of the mass were irregular and poorly defined.  
The mass is involving the confluence, especially the SMV with 
narrowing of vessel diameter.  
FNB was performed. Color doppler was used to determine an 
avascular path for needle aspiration. A 22-gauge needle with a 
stylet was used to perform biopsy.  
Six needle passes were made into the mass.  
Biopsies were sent for pathology.  
Scan of the left hepatic lobe reveled multiple hypoechoic 
lesions measured between 0.5-2cm, highly suspected for 
metastatic disease, FNB was performed from 3 different hepatic 
lesions 
Otherwise normal upper eus to third part of the duodenum

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted for fever and elevated liver tests.  You were 
found to have an obstruction in your biliary system and 
underwent a procedure called ERCP where a stent was placed.  As 
your liver tests continued to trend up, you underwent a second 
ERCP where your previous stent which appeared to have migrated 
was replaced.  Your blood cultures grew two different organisms 
(Klebsiella and enterococcus) and you are being discharged on an 
antibiotic called zosyn which will continue through ___ for a 
total two week course.  Please follow up with your oncologist 
Dr. ___.  

You will also have follow up lab draws to continue to monitor 
your liver tests.

It was a pleasure caring for you - we wish you all the best!
Sincerely, 
Your ___ Oncology Team
