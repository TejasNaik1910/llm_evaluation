History of Present Illness:
Pt is a ___ G0 with h/o T2DM, pulm HTN, Sweet's disease, OSA, 
diverticulitis s/p colectomy who is s/p uncomplicated TAH, BSP, 
PLND and cystoscopy for endometrial cancer on ___ her

vac; prior to transport to the ED, her wound vac was 
discontinued only for
transport reasons.

While in the ED, blood and urine cultures were drawn. CT abd/pel 
was performed which demonstrated 5.6cm fluid collection with 
non-dependent air in the LLQ, consistent with post-op seroma vs 
lymphocele with features suggestive of possible abscess, as well 
as a small amount of free fluid in the anterior abdominal wall. 

She denies fever, chills, abdominal pain, CP, SOB, cough, 
vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, dysuria, incomplete voiding 
or drainage/erythema/pain of her wound. She has urinary

RADIOLOGY:
CT Abd/Pelvis (___):
IMPRESSION:
- 5.6 cm fluid collection containing a locule of non-dependent 
air in the
left mid pelvis, likely a postoperative seroma versus 
lymphocele;
superinfection of this collection is certainly possible, 
especially given
subtle peripheral enhancement, mild adjacent fat stranding, and 
likely
reactive mild asymmetric wall thickening of the adjacent sigmoid 
colon.
- 2-mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule should be followed up 
in one year
given this patient's history of malignancy.
- Hepatic steatosis.
- Bilateral simple renal cysts.
- Fat-containing periumbilical hernia.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was re-admitted to the hospital with 
fever, nausea, and vomiting in the setting of an intra-abdominal 
collection thought to represent an infected lymphocyst.

She reported fevers to 102 @ the rehab facility however was 
afebrile on admission. Notably however, she had a leukocytosis 
and CT of the abd/ pelvis demonstrated a 5.6cm fluid collection 
in the L pelvis with air and mild stranding suggestive of an 
infected seroma or lymphocyst.  Additionally the CXR and UA were 
unremarkable.  She was admitted and started on IV cipro/ flagyl. 
 Blood cultures were obtained prior to initiation of antibiotic 
therapy which ultimately grew bacteroides fragilis in ___ 
bottles.  The next morning she underwent CT guided drainage of 
the collection with drain placement and culture of this fluid 
was polymicrobial.  ID was consulted and recommended IV zosyn/ 
flagyl given polymicrobial infection + bacteremia.  Ultimately 
this was tailored to IV zosyn alone once sensitivities were 
back.  

Subsequently the drain site became indurated with purulent fluid 
around the drain.  Repeat CT showed slight improvement in the 
fluid collection w/ resolution of stranding.  The drain was 
pulled and the area over the site of the drain was extended 
using the scalpel to 1cm.  The site was probed with sign 
drainage of pus and serous fluid.  This site was packed with ___ 
inch packing tape.  Dressing were changed BID.
 
A PICC line was placed for prolonged IV antibiotic therapy.  ID 
recommended a total course of ___ weeks of IV antibiotics and 
they plan to follow her closely following d/c. She will receive 
weekly lab tests. She will follow-up with infectious disease on 
___, and she has a follow-up CT scan scheduled for ___ 
at 9AM.

Other issues during hospitalization:
# Incision: Wound vac was replaced on HD 2 and subsequently 
replaced q 3 days.  The superior part of the incision was noted 
to tunnel superiorly.  Probing released ~20 cc of purulent 
material.  This area was opened further to allow for better 
communication.  
# Intermittent tachycardia noted on tele which she was placed on 
for her h/o OSA.  EKG was performed which was normal sinus 
rhythm.  She remained asymtomatic with a normal heart rate 
during the majority of the day.
# Type 2 diabetes: The patient was continued home pioglitizone + 
ISS.  Her glucose continued to be elevated significantly and 
thus ___ consult was requested.  Her pioglitizone was 
increased to 30mg.  She was started on Lantus and her insulin 
was titrated up. On the day of discharge, it was recommended 
that the patient be transitioned to glipizide 10mg XL instead of 
pioglitazone, given risk of bladder cancer with pioglitazone. 
Upon starting glipizide, it was recommended that the lantus be 
cut in half to 4 and that the patient continue on a sliding 
scale at rehab. Outpatient follow-up with ___ diabetes was 
arranged.
# Pulm HTN/ OSA: cont O2, CPAP
# Depression: cont sertraline
# Sweet's dz w/ mult skin lesions: cont home dapsone, wound 
consult
# On CT of abdomen and pelvis, a 2-mm right lower lobe pulmonary 
nodule was noted and should be followed up in one year

Ms. ___ was discharged to ___ in ___ on 
HD 10 in stable condition.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the gynecology oncology service because you 
had fevers and were found to have a likely infection in your 
abdomen. This was drained and got much better, however, you had 
bacteria found in your blood. Because of this, you have to be on 
IV antibiotics for an extended course, and you have an IV in 
place to allow this to happen. You have remained without a fever 
while in the hospital and your blood cultures have cleared. We 
feel it is safe for you to leave the hospital. Physical therapy 
evaluated you and felt you would need additional care at a rehab 
facility. Please follow the instructions below:

* Do not combine narcotic and sedative medications or alcohol  
* Do not take more than 4000mg acetaminophen (APAP) in 24 hrs  
* No strenuous activity until your post-op appointment  
* Take your medications as prescribed.  
* Do not drive while taking narcotics.  
* Nothing in the vagina (no tampons, no douching, no sex) for 12 
weeks.  
* No heavy lifting of objects >10 lbs for 6 weeks.  
* You may eat a regular diet  

Care of abdominal wound:
* You have a wound vac in place to help with healing of your 
surgical incision. This will be changed at rehab, every 3 days.
* At the site of the drain, there was concern for a developing 
skin infection. The drain site is packed with a wick and will be 
changed twice daily at rehab
* You may shower and allow soapy water to run over incision; no 
scrubbing of incision. No bath tubs for 6 weeks.  

Diabetes Care
* While you are recovering from this infection and healing the 
abdominal wounds, you should continue to take insulin. This is 
VERY important for wound healing.
* Your finger sticks will be checked pre-meals and you will 
continue to receive a sliding scale of insulin
* In addition, a nightly dose of long-acting insulin has been 
added. This may be stopped if your insulin levels start to get 
under control
* Start taking glipizide 10mg XL instead of pioglitazone
* Follow-up with your primary care doctor, ___ 
at ___, when out of rehab to 
discuss any changes in management for your diabetes
* We have also scheduled you to follow-up with the ___ 
Diabetes doctors. Your appointment is listed below.
