History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with h/o esophageal 
cancer s/p esophagectomy ___ who presents for evaluation of 
progressive LLE pain and mild swelling as well as mild dyspnea 
on exertion. Patient describe waking up three days ago with pain 
behind his proximal calf, and distal thigh.  The pain was worse 
the following day and by today he had difficulty walking.  He 
also notes that his left leg is usually smaller than his right 
leg but that it is now slightly more swollen. His ambulation has 
been limited by his leg pain but he also notes that he felt more 
short of breath over the last 48 hours with minimal exertion.  
He denies any shortness of breath at rest, lightheadedness, or 
pleuritic chest pain. Patient denied history of prior personal 
or family history of VTE.  
.  
In the ED, initial VS:  T 98.2 HR 76 BP 146/83 RR 18 SpO2 97% 
RA.
Doppler ultrasound of bilateral lower extremities revealed DVT 
in left popliteal vein extending to the mid portion of the left 
superficial femoral vein. CTA revealed bilateral segmental and 
subsegmental pulmonary embolisms. Heparin IV was started.  
Patient was admitted to the medicine floor for further 
monitoring.
.
.  
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision 
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness 
of breath at rest, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.  
Patient admits to cramping abdominal pain if he eats beef 
products.  He has an open abdominal wound secondary to his 
esophagectomy surgery in ___ that continues to drain and 
reportedly formed a fistula.  The wound requires an ostomy to 
collect drainage. He occasionally has pain near the site of the 
wound.  He has an additional abdominal wound where he briefly 
had a J-tube placed for feedings. The tube persistently leaked 
so was removed 10 days after placement and has yet to heal 
completely.

CTA Chest ___:
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli as above. Increased size of right 
heart cavity concerning for right heart strain. Recommend 
correlation with echocardiogram 
2. Small right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Focal 
opacity at 
the right lower lobe likely focal atelectasis vs early infarct. 
Additional 
areas of atelectasis. 
3. Status post partial esophagectomy (patient has history of 
esophageal 
cancer). Retained material in the lower neoesophagus which is 
mildly 
distended. 
4. Hypodensity in the liver, similar to prior, likely cysts. 
Please note lesion seen on prior in segment VI of the liver is 
not seen on current study, probably due to phase of 
post-contrast imaging. As recommended on prior CT, further 
evaluation with MRI with Eovist is recommended. 
5. Status post splenectomy with multiple soft tissue nodules in 
the left 
upper abdominal quadrant, which could potentially be splenosis 
as suggested on prior imaging. 

LLE u/s ___:
Deep vein thrombosis seen within the left popliteal vein 
extending to the mid portion of the left superficial femoral 
vein. The left tibial veins could not be evaluated as they were 
only minimally visualized.  No DVT is seen in the right leg. 

TTE ___:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF ? 50%) due to inferior 
posterior hypokinesis with focal posterobasal dyskinesis; other 
focal wall motion abnormalities cannot be excluded with 
certainty. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion.

An extensive, large acoustic density is seen abutting, and 
possibly compressing the left atrium. Given the history of 
esophageal cancer with distended lower neoesophagus, this 
probably represents anatomic changes related to this condition.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with h/o esophageal cancer s/p esophagectomy 
___ who presents for evaluation of progressive LLE pain and 
mild swelling as well as mild dyspnea on exertion. 

Bilateral PEs and DVT:  Heparin gtt was started in the ED and 
vascular service was consulted on the floor for placement of IVC 
filter, considering bilateral PE and large DVT in LLE.  Cardiac 
enzymes negative on day of admission, EKG wth no changes c/w R 
heart strain.  IVC filter was placed, tolerated procedure well, 
and heparin gtt was continued while warfarin was started.  
Benefits lovenox for long term anticoagulation were discussed 
with the patient, who has a h/o esophageal cancer, however pt 
did not want to use lovenox for the long term and preferred 
warfarin. Atenolol was held.  Patient remained hemodynamically 
stable and echo, which had suboptimal image quality, did not 
show evidence of R heart strain.  He was discharged with an INR 
of 2.3 ___ first day of therapeutic INR, goal ___ on coumadin 
dose of 5 mg daily, and with two days of overlap with 
therapeutic lovenox.  His PCP was contacted regarding referral 
to outpatient ___ clinic.

HTN: Held home atenolol given large PEs, and BP remained stable 
with SBP 120s-130s. could consider restarting as an outpatient

Wound/Ostomy care: wound care nursing was consulted for ostomy 
and fistula wounds

Gout: Pt with h/o gout that tends to flare when he feels 
dehydrated.  He is not on long term uric acid therapy.  On HD 2, 
he noted a gout flare in his R and L great toes, R>L, and for 
this he received colchicine.  He will take colchicine for the 
next ___ days until gout flare resolves.  Would consider long 
term uric acid suppression therapy as an outaptient

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen in the hospital for leg pain and mild shortness of 
breath.  These symptoms were most likely caused by a deep vein 
thrombosis (blood clot) in your leg and pulmonary emboli (blood 
clots in your lungs).  For this, you had a filter placed in your 
inferior vena cava (large vein leading to your heart) to prevent 
clots from spreading from your left leg to your lungs.  You were 
also started on an IV blood thinner (heparin) along with 
coumadin to treat your blood clots and prevent new clots from 
forming.  You will be on lovenox for two more days as your INR 
(bloodwork that monitors coumadin) becomes therapeutic.

Your IVC filter will not prevent you from getting an MRI in the 
future and it should not cause problems with metal detectors or 
at the airport.

Changes to your medications:
START taking coumadin 5 mg daily
START taking colchicine 0.6 mg daily for the next two to three 
days, depending on if you are still having symptoms.  You should 
talk to your primary care doctor about the possiblity of 
starting long term treatment for gout.

STOP taking atenolol until you follow up with your primary care 
doctor
 
Followup Instructions:
