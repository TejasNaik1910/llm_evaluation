History of Present Illness:
___ year old male with metastatic RCC to brain s/p cyberknife, 
HTN, HL and COPD who presents with confusion.

He has been at rehab for the last 3 months after a 
hospitalization in ___ for new diagnosis of metastatic RCC 
to brain.  He used up his 100 days of rehab and was discharged 
home 9 days ago.  He lives with his daughter and had an 
extensive plan for care including home health aides, ___, ___, 
and many family members.  He was doing well for a few days and

dark and had been started on a course of cipro which was due to 
be completed tomorrow.  No BM in 5 days.  Of note, he has a 
sacral ulcer which is being cared for by a wound nurse.

Notably, he was admitted ___ to the MICU with fevers and 
hypotension felt to be due to urosepsis.  Urine culture had no 
growth and he was discharged with a 10 day course of IV cefepime 
which finished ___.  

Currently, the patient is confused and thinks he is in the 
hospital because he fell on his butt.  Only complains of butt 
pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with metastatic RCC to brain s/p cyberknife, 
HTN, HL and COPD who presents with confusion.
.
# Acute encephalopathy: He presented with acute toxic/metabolic 
encephalopathy felt to be multifactorial.  He was profoundly 
dehydrated, hypercalcemic, with a positive UA and has known 
brain mets.  He was started on vanco/cefepime and given 
aggressive IV fluids and pamidronate.  His mental status mildly 
improved with these measures.  He had a CT head and an MRI with 
conrast that showed no change in brain mets. He was occasionally 
agitated and combative which was treated with haldol 0.5-1.0 mg 
TID prn and scheduled at HS without excessive sedation.  
.
# Hypotension: He was hypotensive to the 80's/___'s shortly after 
admission.  He was given multiple fluid boluses and 
vanco/cefepime with improvement in his blood pressure.  He had 
recently been on decadron but AM cortisol was elevated and he 
was not felt to be adrenally insufficient.  Home hydralazine, 
atenolol, and lasix were discontinued.
.
# Hypercalcemia: He had a corrected calcium of 13 on admission.  
He was given IV fluids and pamidronate with improvement of his 
calcium.  This was felt to account for some of his mental status 
changes.  PTH was appropriately suppressed.
.
# Renal cell carcinoma with brain mets s/p cyberknife: He was 
not on any systemic chemotherapy due to his relatively low 
burden of disease.  He had a restaging CT torso which showed 
enlargement of his renal mass and multiple new pulmonary 
metastases.  Head CT and MRI showed stable brain mets and edema. 
 CT torso also showed tumor thrombus in the right renal vein but 
given lack of established benefit of anticoagulation and his 
brain mets, he was not anticoagulated. After discussion with 
___ and ___, his daughters who are his health care proxies, 
it was decided that the patient should be DNR/DNI and 
transitioned to hospice care with a palliative focus. 
.
# UTI: Completed course of ciprofloxacin for UTI prior to 
admission and received 3 days of cefepime here.  Urine culture 
contaminated with mixed flora. repeat urine cx negative. D/C'd 
cefepime per ID recs. Blood cultures were negative.
.
# ___ weakness: He has known ___ weakness from brain mets and 
patient has not walked at all in several weeks.  His weakness 
appeared stable from prior exam.
. 
# Multiple pressure ulcers: He had a stage IV sacral decubitus 
ulcer and several stage I ulcers (left heel, right hip) on 
admission.  The general surgery team was consulted and placed a 
wound vac.  He was started on MS contin for basal pain control 
given his significant pain and difficulty asking for pain 
medication.  He was also continued on MSIR and IV morphine as 
needed.
. 
# Atrial flutter: He was in atrial flutter with 4:1 block on 
admission.  During episodes of hypotension, he would have 
variable conduction with some RVR with 3:1 block (HRs 120's).  
He was started on low dose metoprolol (in place of his home 
atenolol) which he tolerated well and remained rate-controlled.
.
# Anemia: Hct was 22 on admission and he was given 2 units of 
PRBCs over the course of his hospitalization.  Stools were 
guaiac negative.  Iron studies were consistent with anemia of 
inflammatory block.
.
# RUE swelling: Ultrasound was negative for DVT and his edema 
became more symmetric consistent with anasarca.
.
# COPD: Continued on home spiriva and albuterol.
.
# HL: Discontinued home atorvastatin given his goals of care.
.
# Constipation: He had had no BM in 5 days on admission.  This 
was likely related to hypercalcemia and perhaps narcotics use.  
He was given an aggressive bowel regimen and his constipation 
resolved.
.
# Anxiety: Continued home zoloft.  He had been on trazodone TID 
at night but this discontinued due to confusion and sedation at 
the time of his admission.
.
# Malnutrition: He had albumin level of 1.4-1.7 during admission 
and had very little oral intake.  He began eating small amounts 
as his mental status cleared.  He developed anasarca with IV 
fluid resuscitation

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - always.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Bedbound.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with confusion.  This was felt 
to be from several reasons including a bladderinfection, high 
calcium levels, cancer in your brain, and dehydration.  You were 
given IV antibiotics and IV fluids and medicine to decrease your 
high calcium. Your confusion improved but your thinking did not 
entirely return to normal.  A CT scan of your body showed that 
your cancer has grown in your lungs. An MRI of your brain showed 
that your brain metastases were stable.  You had a wound vac 
placed on your sacral ulcer to promote healing. After discussion 
with your daughters who are your health care proxies, you were 
made DNR/DNI and will be transferred to hospice. The focus of 
your care will be on your symptoms to keep you as comfortable as 
possilbe.
