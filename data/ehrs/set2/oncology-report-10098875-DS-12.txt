Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
========
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with triple negative local left 
breast cancer on abraxane and atezolizumab presenting initially 
with hypoxemic respiratory failure likely ___ checkpoint 
inhibitor-induced pneumonitis, found to have cryptococcal 
meningitis, MDR E coli UTI, DIC, diarrhea, and persistent non-AG 
metabolic acidosis thought to be ___ RTA. 

ACUTE PROBLEMS:
===============
# Encephalopathy 
# Possible cryptococcal meningitis
# Possible checkpoint-inhibitor induced encephalitis 
Found down on presentation. Neurology and infectious disease 
were consulted. An extensive workup was sent including CT head, 
EEG, MRI, LP, and multiple serologic tests. Ultimately, a 
positive serum cryptococcal Ag was present and patient's LP was 
inflammatory, concerning for cryptococcal meningitis in an 
immunosuppressed patient. The patient was treated with 
amphotericin and flucytosine for cryptococcal meningitis. She 
improved both symptomatically and in terms of her inflammatory 
CSF on treatment for fungal infection and possibly some 
improvement with steroids for pneumonitis, so she was 
transitioned to oral fluconazole, which she should continue 
fluconazole for 8 weeks total (stop date: ___. Follow up with 
Infectious Diseases is scheduled on ___. Please monitor 
weekly QTc. 

# Diarrhea
She had difficulties with diarrhea intermittently on tube feeds 
during hospitalization, but worsened over a few day period. 
Given other checkpoint inhibitor-induced side effects, GI was 
consulted for concern for checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis. 
Infectious workup was notable for negative bacterial cultures, 
c. diff, norovirus, and ova and parasites. She was started on 
fiber TID with tube feeds and Lomotil with significant 
improvement. Stools were semi-formed by discharge but persistent 
frequency. Will require GI follow up as outpatient for further 
workup and possible EGD/colonoscopy. 

# New ascites
# Imaging concerning for cirrhosis
Patient with worsening abdominal distention. CT abdomen showed a 
cirrhotic liver and large volume non-hemorrhagic ascites s/p 
paracentesis on ___ with 3L of inflammatory fluid removed. 
Cytology was negative for cancerous cells, although was a small 
volume sample sent. A workup for the cause was sent including 
hepatitis titers and an ___, which were notable for positive ___ 
at 1:1280 and Hep B cAb positive with negative VL. She is immune 
to Hep A. She should establish care with Hepatology and have a 
hepatitis B vaccine.

# Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, resolved
# Checkpoint-inhibitor induced pneumonitis
Given initial concern for pneumonia, she was treated with 
piperacillin-tazobactam then Bactrim, which were later 
discontinued given no focal consolidation. She was treated with 
a steroid taper, which is due to end on ___ with resolution of 
her oxygen requirement and dyspnea.

# Nausea/vomiting 
Intermittently having nausea/vomiting during her 
hospitalization. Tried on Reglan with significant improvement, 
but then she had diarrhea, so this was held. EGD was 
unremarkable. She should follow up with GI if persists. She 
frequently required IV Zofran for symptomatic relief. 

# Hyperglycemia
Likely secondary to steroids and tube feeds. Started on insulin 
with improvement. Please titrate as necessary. A1c was 6.0.

# Deconditioning
Likely ___ critical illness. ___, OT, SLP consulted. 

# Hyponatremia
# Hypernatremia
Had difficulties with both, likely secondary to amount of free 
water flushes with her tube feeds. Normalized by discharge. 

# Severe protein calorie malnutrition
# Dysphagia
Started on tube feeds through a Dobhoff via nutrition, as SLP 
felt she was not safe for PO intake. 

# Sinus tachycardia
Asymptomatic, likely secondary to critical illness. CT imaging 
of the heart was unremarkable. Consider further workup with 
echocardiogram in future if persists. 

# Thrombocytopenia
# Anemia: 
# DIC: 
While in the ICU, thought to have DIC given fibrinogen 73 and 
d-dimer elevated. These improved with treatment of her 
underlying disease. Low suspicion for TTP or HIT. She received 
multiple units of pRBCs, cryoglobulins. GI was consulted for 
possible GI bleed, but EGD was unrevealing and she did not have 
overt GI bleeding. DIC resolved. Required weekly pRBC 
transfusions with last one on ___. 

# Non-anion Gap metabolic acidosis: 
# Hypokalemia
Blood gases from ___ with normal pH with a presentation 
consistent with proximal RTA. Renal was consulted and 
recommended avoiding bicarb replacement if possible, as this 
would precipitate renal loss of potassium. Patient required 
frequent potassium replacement given renal potassium wasting. 
Please check 3x/weekly labs

# MDR E. coli UTI
The patient was treated for an MDR e. coli UTI with Zosyn, which 
was later changed to meropenem to complete a course.

# Breast cancer, triple negative, locally advanced 
On abraxane and atezolizumab as an outpatient, which were held 
during hospitalization per her primary Oncologist, Dr. ___. 
Recommend outpatient follow up after rehab. Dressings were 
changed daily.
