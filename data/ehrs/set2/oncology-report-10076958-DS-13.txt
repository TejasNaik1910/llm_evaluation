Impression: Evidence of a previous esophago-gastric anastomosis

lesion.  Esophagitis and esophageal irritation was seen proximal 
to the anastamosis potentially secondary to recent food 
impaction. A 12mm balloon was introduced for dilation and the 
diameter was progressively increased to 15 mm successfully.
