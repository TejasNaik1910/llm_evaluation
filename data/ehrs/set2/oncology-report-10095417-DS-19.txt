Impression: The scout film showed a plastic stent in the RUQ. 
A plastic stent was emerging from the major papilla. The stent 
was successfully removed using a snare. 
The CBD was successfully cannulated using a CleverCut 
sphincterotome preloaded with 0.025in guidewire. 
Contrast injection revealed dilated CBD at approximately 15mm 
in diameter with few filling defects consistent with sludge. 
A biliary sphincterotomy was successfully performed at 12 
O'clock position. There was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding. 
The bile duct was swept multiple times using a biliary balloon. 

A small amount of sludge material was successfully removed. 
Occlusion cholangiogram revealed no more filling defects. 
There was excellent contrast and bile drainaige at the end of 
the procedure.
 

Recommendations: Admit to hospital for monitoring 
NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration with LR at 200 cc/hr 

If no abdominal pain in the morning, advance diet to clear 
liquids and then advance as tolerated 
If safe, hold blood thinner for 3 days. 
Follow-up with referring physician as previously scheduled.
