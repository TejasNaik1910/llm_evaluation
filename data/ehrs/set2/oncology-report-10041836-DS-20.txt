Intraop fluoro:
FINDINGS: ___ fluoroscopic images of the femur 
demonstrate interval 
placement of an intramedullary rod with proximal gamma nail

left femur biopsy, left

CT Hip:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Large aggressive lytic lesion of left proximal femur most 
likely 
representing metastasis. This lesion is at risk for pathologic 
fracture and protected weight-bearing should be considered. 
  
2. In addition, evidence of existing non-displaced pathologic 
fracture at the subcapital femoral neck and, also, a pathologic 
avulsion fracture at the tip of the left greater trochanter. 
  
2. Suspected additional smaller metastatic marrow deposit in the 
mid shaft of the left femur. 
  
3. Anterior abdominal wall hernia.

- Today is D5 of appropriate antibiotics.  Plan D/c antibiotics 
on ___.
.
# L hip fracture; pathologic. Suspicious for malignancy -
Pt with two month history of low back pain and LLE pain. Neuro 
exam reveals upper motor neuron signs on BLE. Pt with signif 
weakness of foot dorsiflexion L>R. With history of metastatic CA 
concern was for metastatic dz.
- Pt refused MRI T/L spine,  so CT L spine, hip, L leg ordered 
and showed large lytic lesion at proximal femur and 
non-displaced pathologic fx at femoral neck on L side. 
- Pt underwent ORIF of L femur on ___. 
- Per ortho full wt bearing post-op.
- Seen by ___, needs rehab 
- Percocet has been ordered, and has been sucessful in treating 
patient's pain, however, pt has not been requesting despite 
pain.  Recommend offering pain medication to patient q4-6hrs, 
allowing patient to refuse if without pain. 
- Pt's oncologist, Dr. ___, is aware of the news and thinks 
this could be endometrial cancer primary; however, would like a 
biopsy given pt's hx of colon ca. 
-Pt will need radonc consult as an outpt to consider if XRT may 
be beneficial; pending biopsy results.  This has been deferred 
to outpatient, pending biopsy results.
-___ appt w PcP set up for next week. Dr ___ discussed with PCP 
that based on bone bx results, pt will either need to be 
referred back to her endometrial ca oncologist ___. ___  or 
colon ca oncologist (Dr. ___ to consider future tx

had been taking it, so that was restarted.

therapeutic dose of lovenox.  
- Coumadin resumed on ___ with a low dose of 2 mg considering 
starting INR of 1.9 on ___. Patient is likely nutritionally 
Vitamin K deplete, and will not likely need much Coumadin to 
obtain therapeutic INR.  Patient will need close INR monitoring 
and titration of coumadin dose.
