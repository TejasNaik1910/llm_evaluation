Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
right pleural effusion
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ right chest tube placed

 
History of Present Illness:
In brief, ___ is a ___ year old man w/PMH HBV on 
tenofovir
c/b HCC s/p R hepatic lobectomy ___, HTN, and BPH who
presented on ___ with two weeks of chest pain/tightness and
subjective fevers with increased sputum production. He was
admitted to the transplant surgery service. CTA showed large R
pleural effusion w/associated RML and RLL collapse and pleural
nodules suggestive of metastatic HCC. IP was consulted and 
placed
pigtail catheter. 800cc of serosanguinous fluid was removed and
fluid studies were consistent with transudative effusion (LDH
669, cholesterol 66). Cytology returned negative for malignancy
and cultures are no growth to date. IP is considering
MT/pleurodesis/TPC for definitive diagnosis and management.  

On surveillance staging imaging ___, patient was found to have
pleural nodules suspicious for metastases, a new nonocclusive
filling defect in the suprahepatic IVC which could represent
thrombus or tumor thrombus, and multiple new small pulmonary
nodules with mediastinal LAD concerning for metastases.

On evaluation this evening, Mr. ___ is feeing well and is 
without
complaint. He states that his pain medication is adequately
controlling his pain from the chest tube. Denies cough, fever,
chills, chest pain, shortness of breath. He denies personal or
family history of blood clots.

Pertinent Results:
___ Chest CT: 

The previously large right pleural effusion drained by a basal 
pigtail
catheter, is much smaller and contains small air collections 
incidental to
drain placement.
 
High attenuation pleural nodules are likely metastases, but some 
could be
clot.  Image guided transthoracic needle aspiration should be 
feasible.
 
A nonocclusive filling defect is new or newly apparent in the 
supra hepatic
IVC and could be thrombus or tumor thrombus.  Doppler ultrasound 
evaluation
could better differentiate these.
 
Small pulmonary nodules are new since ___ and more 
prominent though small mediastinal lymphadenopathy are likely 
metastases.

___ CT A/P:
 
1. Moderately-sized nonocclusive filling defect in the 
suprahepatic inferior
vena cava approximately at the bifurcation of the middle and 
left hepatic
veins. The middle and left hepatic veins are widely patent.
2. The patient is status post right hepatectomy with expected 
postsurgical
changes.
3. There are no hepatic lesions that meet OPTN 5 criteria for 
hepatocellular
carcinoma.
4. Moderate right pleural effusion with subcutaneous drainage 
catheter in
place.
5. Fusiform dilatation of the right renal artery at the 
bifurcation in the
right hilum measuring 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm.

___ AP radiograph of the chest. 
  
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
The right basilar chest tube has been removed. The small to 
moderate right 
pleural effusion with locules of air and compressive atelectasis 
of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe are not 
significantly changed compared to prior study, allowing for 
differences in patient's respiratory effort. There is no new 
consolidation. No pneumothorax is identified. The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in appearance. There are 
no acute osseous abnormalities. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ was admitted to the Transplant Surgery service on 
___ with a large right sided pleural effusion. 
Interventional Pulmonology was consulted and a ___ chest tube 
was placed, draining 800 of serosanguinous fluid. This was sent 
for pleural studies. 

Pleural studies revealed a lymphocytic exudative effusion. Upon 
further review of the CT chest obtained on admission, pleural 
nodules were noted, concerning for metastasis of hepatocellular 
carcinoma. An AFP was sent; this was 31, increased from 19 prior 
to his hepatic lobectomy. Cytology from the pleural fluid did 
not show any malignant cells.

Nonetheless, given concerns for metastatic disease, a staging CT 
scan (already previously scheduled as an outpatient) was 
performed. This demonstrated pleural nodules, again concerning 
for metastasis, as well as a suprahepatic IVC thrombus (bland). 
The patient was started on therapeutic Lovenox for this. Given 
these findings, the patient was therefore transferred to 
Medicine for further oncologic workup.   Pt had the chest tube 
removed by IP and continued to have mild right sided chest pain 
and low grade fevers without any N/V/D or urinary symptoms.  
Repeat CXR was stable and pt was eager to get home for Christmas 
with his family.   We spoke at length with patient and family 
(daughter who is a ___) about our concerns for recurrent 
cancer.   We also explained the lack of diagnostic certainly and 
need for close follow up as outlined below.  We emailed his 
primary oncologist who was able to get him in for follow-up 
right after ___.  Pt was given teaching and was discharged 
on lovenox 60mg SubQ BID.  Lovenox was chosen because he will 
likely need additional procedures with IP in the next ___ weeks 
and wouldn't want them delayed by the washout time required of a 
DOAC. 

Follow Up:
- Interventional pulmonology: Follow up in ___ clinic w/ Dr. ___ 
in 2 weeks for thoracoscopyand biopsy of pleural nodules
- Oncologist: Dr. ___ on ___ at 11:30
