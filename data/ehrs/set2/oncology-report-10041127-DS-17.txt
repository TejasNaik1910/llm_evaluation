RADIOLOGY
=========
KUB ___ - No evidence of small bowel obstruction; please 
correlate with 
subsequently performed CT of the abdomen and pelvis. 
.
CXR ___ - No evidence of pneumonia or free air. Small right 
pleural 
effusion and mild bibasilar atelectasis.  
.
CT ___. No significant change in the appearance of the 
liver which is diffusely replaced with metastases. Interval 
increase in the amount of abundant abdominal and pelvic free 
fluid. No definite common bile duct dilatation identified. 
2. Mildly distended small bowel loops represent mild ileus with 
no evidence for obstruction. 
  
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Assesment/Plan: ___ hx neuroendocrine cancer of the liver or  
intrahepatic biliary tree which has been deemed unresectable and 
 
has progressed despite chemotherapy, with malignant ascites 
which causes early satiety, admitted with constipation and found 
to be hypercalcemic. Abdominal pain now improved and calcium 
normalized. Overall continues to improve and goal to transition 
to hospice care at home in coming ___ days.  
.  
# Hypercalcemia - Most likely related to underying 
neuroendocrine malignancy. PTH low, but there is no real 
indication to test for PRHrp right now. We can likely conclude 
that patient would have elevated PTHrp. Componenent of abdominal 
pain and constipation likely related to elevated calcium. Exam 
without signs of hypercalcemia. Received vigorous hydration, two 
doses of lasix, bisphoshanate x1, and calcitonin x 1. Did not 
receive steroids. Calcium trended down during hospital stay and 
normalized at the time of discharge.   

.  
# Cholangitis - Clinically met criteria for cholangitis on 
admission given low grade fever, abdominal pain and jaundice. 
Bilirubin and AST remain elevated with ALT at baseline. Ddx also 
includes cholecystitis and choledocholethiasis. Pt has stable 
hemodynamics and now afebrile. Most likely, worsening of primary 
cancer. Patient oriented, but visibly jaunidced and + asterexis. 
CT abdomen did not demonstrate any cbd dilitation so there is no 
indication for ERCP at this time.  LFTs remained elevated and 
bilirubin remained elvated. Patient was placed on Zosyn on 
admission but stopped on ___ given normal WBC and lack of 
fever. Patient was not febrile again and WBC remained normal. 
.  
# neuroendocrine cancer - After discussion with Dr. ___ ( 
oncology fellow) patient likely has HCC. Has been off treatment 
since early ___ and no longer a candidate for chemotherapy. A 
palliative care consult was called, and family along with 
patient decided to seek hospice care at home. 
  
.  
# Ascites - CT scan now showing small interval increase in 
ascites quantity. Paracenesis performed ___ prior to 
hospitilization was negative for SBP. A palliative paracentesis 
was performed on ___ that removed 5 L of fluid. 
.  
# GIB - Has h/o of grade II varices. Multiple guaiac stools in 
hospital, but hemodynamically stable and hct stable. Notes he 
had one black tarry stool 4 weeks PTA, but none since then. Hct 
remained stable and pt did not receive transfusions. Given 
prognosis of the patient, a GI consult was not pursued and 
patient was asymptomatic from GIB.  
.  
# Code- Patient wished to remain full code during hospital stay

You presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and 
constipation. You were found to have a very high calcium level 
in your blood that was likely responsible for these symptoms.

calcitonin. Your calcium level continued to trend down until 
discharge.

paracentesis was performed to remove fluid to relieve your 
discomfort. You tolerated this procedure level. 
.
After several discussions with palliatve care, the decision was
