PERTINENT STUDIES:
==================
TEE ___
There is no spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the body of 
the left atrium/left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage 
ejection velocity is normal. The interatrial septum is dynamic, 
but not frankly aneurysmal. There is no evidence for an atrial 
septal defect by 2D/color Doppler though evaluation was limited 
by tachycardia and limited images obtained. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is at least mildly depressed with 
beat-to-beat variability in the left ventricular contractility 
due to the irregular rhythm. The right ventricle has moderate 
global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the 
descending aorta to from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No abscess is seen. 
There is trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets 
appear structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. No 
masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. No abscess 
is seen. There is mild to moderate [___] mitral regurgitation.  
The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. No 
mass/vegetation are seen on the tricuspid valve. No abscess is 
seen. There is tricuspid regurgitation present (could not be 
qualified).

IMPRESSION: No vegetations or intracardiac thrombus seen. Mild 
global biventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild to moderate 
mitral regurgitation.

CTA Chest ___
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Pulmonary emboli extending from the distal right main 
pulmonary artery to segmental level in right upper and middle 
lobes and subsegmental level in right lower lobe.  No left-sided 
pulmonary emboli.  Difficult to exclude right heart strain.  
Echocardiogram would further assess. 
2.  No focal consolidation. 
3.  Mild nodular contour of the liver raise concern for 
cirrhosis.  
Correlation with liver function test is recommended for further 
evaluation. 
4.  Status post splenectomy. 

U/S of ___ ___
IMPRESSION:   
Non-occlusive deep vein thrombus of one right posterior tibial 
vein. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with history of CAD s/p DES to LAD (___), 
HIV
on HAART, HTN, HLD, diabetes, prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy,
CKD, salmonella splenic abscess s/p splenectomy (___), and 
prior
hepatitis B infection admitted w/ submassive PE and AF w/ RVR.

ACUTE ISSUES
============
# SUBMASSIVE PULMONARY EMBOLISM
# RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY DVT
Notable for TTE with evidence of right heart strain as well as 
mild troponin elevation. Never hypotensive, initiated on heparin 
gtt upon arrival, quickly weaned to RA. Appears unprovoked at 
this time: no signs of active malignancy,
immobilization (although obese, not active), operations, or 
family history. Transitioned to warfarin, discharged on ___ 
bridge.

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION W/ RVR
No prior records of Afib. Likely provoked ___ PE. Had rates 
difficult to control despite escalating doses of metoprolol and 
initiation of PO amiodarone. Hence, he had TEE and DCCV ___, 
successful, remained in sinus at time of discharge. 
Anticoagulation as above. Restarted on home dose metop succinate 
25mg daily after DCCV, continued on PO amiodarone.

# Acute on Chronic HFpEF: 
TTE this admission w/ poor image quality, noted depressed 
systolic function but could not determine EF. If EF was 
decreased, likely rate related I/s/o Afib w/ RVR. Mildly volume 
overloaded on exam initially, responded well to low dose IV 
diuresis, did not require PO diuretic at time of discharge.

# RLE Cellulitis: noted upon arrival, nonpurulent, started on 
cephalexin for ___ORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
s/p DES to LAD (___). Mild troponin elevation likely 
reflective of right heart strain from acute PE. Chest pain free. 
Continued ASA, statin, ___, and BB as above. D/c'd Plavix given 
initiation of AC, and > ___ year since stent placement.

# RADIOGRAPHIC LIVER ABNORMALITY
Mild nodular contour of the liver raises concern for cirrhosis. 
Consider. outpatient Fibroscan and possibly hepatology referral.

CORE MEASURES: 
=================================
# HIV
Most recent VL undetectable. CD4 of 500. Continued home HAART 
regimen (Darunavir 800 mg PO QHS, Cobicistat 150 mg PO QHS, 
Odefsey 200-25-25 mg oral QHS)

# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Fenofibrate 145 mg PO DAILY in addition to 
statin (both home meds)

# DIABETES: held PO meds, placed on insulin sliding scale.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] given unprovoked PE, ensure age appropriate malignancy 
screening has been done. if unremarkable, consider 
hypercoagulability w/u.
[] currently on lovenox bridge until warfarin therapeutic. 
Increased warfarin dose to 10mg daily on day of discharge. Will 
need close monitoring and titration of warfarin dose, d/c 
lovenox when INR > 2.
[] ___ of Hearts monitor at time of discharge
[] PO amiodarone started I/s/o difficult to control AF w/ RVR. 
Please re-evaluate its need moving forward.
[] cephalexin for RLE cellulitis for 7 day course. Please 
re-evaluate leg. pt diabetic and high risk for PVD, consider 
noninvasive flow studies.
[] repeat TTE in several weeks to eval interval change from 
prior, define EF, ensure not newly reduced
[] monitor for signs of increased volume, start diuretic as 
necessary
[] outpatient Fibroscan and possibly hepatology referral given 
liver appearance on imaging, high risk for NASH
[] on ASA/Plavix upon arrival for DES in ___. Given > ___ year, 
and placed on warfarin, d/c'd Plavix use.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___!

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED
=====================
You were admitted after we found blood clots in your lungs and 
legs. You were also in an abnormal heart rhythm. 

WHAT DID WE DO FOR YOU HERE
===========================
We started you on blood thinners for the clots. We then shocked 
your heart back into a normal rhythm. 

WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE
=====================================
- It is really important that you take your blood thinner 
(warfarin) as prescribed. You need to have regular blood checks 
to make sure the blood thinner is at a good level (INR between 2 
and 3). 
- You need to see a cardiologist (heart doctor) after you leave 
the hospital.
- You were discharged on an event monitor that will record your 
heart rhythm if it is triggered. If you feel palpitations, 
trigger the monitor so your cardiologist can see if your heart 
goes back into an abnormal rhythm.
- Please weigh yourself every morning. If your weight increases 
by more than 3lbs in one day or 5 lbs in one week, please call 
your cardiologist to consider adding a medicine that will keep 
the extra fluid out of your body.

We wish you the best of health,

Your ___ Care Team
