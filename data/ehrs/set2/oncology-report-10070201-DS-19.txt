___
CXR - Lungs are low volume with subsegmental atelectasis in the 
left lung base and right lung base.  Right IJ line has been 
removed in the interim. 
Cardiomediastinal silhouette stable.  No pneumothorax is seen.  
No new 
consolidations concerning for pneumonia. 

PFT ___
IMPRESSION
MECHANICS: The ___ and FEV1 are moderately reduced. The FEV1/FVC 
ratio is normal. There was no
significant change following inhaled bronchodilator.
FLOW-VOLUME LOOP: Mildly reduced flows with an early termination 
of exhalation.
LUNG VOLUMES: The TLC and FRC are mildly reduced. The RV is 
normal. The RV/TLC ratio is elevated.
DLCO: The diffusion capacity uncorrected for hemoglobin is 
moderately reduced.
Impression:
Moderate gas exchange defect. Although results suggest a mild 
restrictive ventilatory defect the FVC
may be underestimated due to an early termination of exhalation 
and the RV is likely overestimated
and/or TLC underestimated due to a suboptimal SVC manuever. 
There are no prior studies available for
comparison.

LV mass pathology 
Mass, left ventricle, extraction:
- Partially organized fibrinous nodule (0.7 cm) with focal 
dystrophic calcification and extensive
associated histiocytic reaction (highlighted by a CD68 
immunostain).
- No malignancy identified; immunostains for cytokeratin 
cocktail and S100 are negative for any
lesional cells.
- Gram and GMS stains are negative for microorganisms.
Note: See associated microbiologic culture results ___ 
___ ___ for further
characterization.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred from OSH ___ with significant coronary artery 
disease.  He was evaluated by cardiology and felt to be better 
served by bypass surgery.  He underwent preoperative workup 
including pulmonary function test.   He remained hemodynamically 
stable and was taken to the operating room on ___. He 
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x4 and removal of 
intracardiac tumor. Please see operative note for full details. 
He was taken to the intensive care unit post operative for 
management.  Later that evening he was weaned from sedation, 
awoke and was extubated requiring face mask.  On post operative 
day one he was started on Lasix drip for diuresis due to 
increasing oxygen requirement.  He was started on betablockers 
and weaned of vasodilator drip.   He however due to agitation 
and confusion was started on precede drip and then also treated 
with Haldol.  Over the next few days he remained delirious with 
hypoxia and renal function worsened with noted acute kidney 
injury.  Diuretics were adjusted and he was weaned down on 
oxygen to nasal cannula.  His delirium was improving with 
improved sleep.  His chest tubes and epicardial wires were 
removed per protocol.  He was transitioned to the floor on post 
operative day six.  He was weaned to room air and creatinine was 
improving but not fully to baseline.  He worked with physical 
and occupational therapy with recommendation for acute rehab.  
He was clinically stable for discharge to acute rehab on post 
operative day nine.  Continues with oral Lasix for diuresis, 
delirium resolving but still forgetful at times.  Recommend 
recheck labs in few days to evaluate renal function and lytes.  
He was discharged to ___ rehab in ___.  He was continued on 
insulin until creatinine stable to resume oral diabetic 
medications and was not placed on ___ for NSTEMI due to ___.
