Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
chest pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation

 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ man with CAD s/p MI ___ years ago, 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, and poorly differentiated metastatic 
squamous cell lung cancer who was discharged from the ___ 
service yesterday after an admission for hemoptysis and jaw 
pain, during which he was found to have a large left pleural 
effusion thought to be malignant in etiology and s/p therapeutic 
thoracentesis yesterday during which only 500cc of fluid was 
removed, who went on to develop chest pain and diaphoresis at 
3am overnight. He awoke with this pain and diaphoresis and was 
taken to ___ ED where he was noted to be in A-fib w/ 
RVR and hypotensive. He was started on a diltiazem gtt and IVF, 
and transferred to the ___ ED. In the ED here he continued to 
have chest pain and diaphoresis, and was hypotensive to the ___, 
so he cardioverted at 7am with 100J into NSR. His SBPs were 
initially sustained in the ___ (in the setting of receiving 
Versed prior to the cardioversion), but increased in the setting 
of having a Cudet catheter placed, after which he has been in 
the high ___. Labs revealed baseline CBC, elevated 
creatinine (1.2 from 0.9), hyperkalemia (5.4), troponin 0.04, 
and lactate 2.1. CXR showed worsening of his effusion from 
yesterday, and CTA showed no PE but did show a left hilar mass 
with new collapse of the left main bronchus and LLL > LUL 
atelectasis, as well as larger metastatic masses compared with 
CT ___. He received a total of about 3L NS IVF, with 250cc 
UOP. He is being admitted to the CCU for further care. VS just 
prior to transfer: HR 69, BP 90/64, SaO2 100% 2L NC.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient chest pain free and in sinus 
rhythm in the ______.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, black stools or red 
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the 
other review of systems were negative.
.  
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on 
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, 
syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
=======
Portable TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 2:35:18 ___      FINAL 
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the 
basal half of the inferior wall and mid inferolateral wall. The 
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w 
CAD. Increased PCWP

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 6:46 AM 
Left lobe remains collapsed, extent of a left pleural 
abnormality has 
increased since ___ suggesting bleeding or infection 
in the setting of extensive intrathoracic malignancy involving 
the lung, hilus, pleural space and probably the mediastinum. 
Enlargement of the mediastinal contour since ___ may 
reflect pericardial effusion. Clinical correlation recommended 
to exclude cardiac tamponade. Right pleural thickening is 
longstanding, and probably not malignant. Right lung is clear 

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of ___ 
7:02 AM 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Left hilar masses have progressed to now cause obliteration 
of the left 
main bronchus, with associated collapse of the left lower lobe 
and lingula as well as atelectasis in the left upper lobe. 
Dominant left lower lobe mass is again noted. Small left pleural 
effusion is slightly increased. Size of multiple metastatic 
lesions including left axillary and posterior chest wall soft 
tissue masses as well as right adrenal and bilateral pleural 
nodules are all increased in size. 
2. No pulmonary embolism is seen. 

Cytology:
========
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ yo M with poorly differentiated squamous lung 
cancer on carboplatin/taxol ___ s/p thoracentesis with 
500cc fluid removed now getting XRT to L lung. Night of 
discharge, patient presented to ___ with chest pain 
and diaphoresis A-fib w/ RVR and hypotensive. No history of Afib 
with RVR, cardioverted. Found to have NSTEMI given statin. EP 
saw patient for rhythm control, put patient on sotalol.  ekg 
this am with normal QTc. No change in shortness of breath, 
continues to have same oxygen requirement. Patient s/p bronch 
APC for hemopytysis, XRT for R jaw met, Patient started XRT to 
lung and as resumed minimal hemoptysis.
.  
Patient is a ___ year old male with metastatic poorly 
differentiated squamous lung ca with multiple mets and L main 
bronchus obliteration on carboplatin/taxol ___,  who on 
night of most recent discharge after thoracentesis, had acute CP 
and was found to be in afib with RVR.  He was cardioverted, sent 
to the CCU for monitoring.  He sustained an NSTEMI and was put 
on high dose statin.  Anticoagulation was withheld given 
hemoptysis and potential for aggressive endobronchial lesion.  
He was also seen by EP and given sotalol for rate/rhythm control
. 
# SCHF - secondary to repeat NSTEMI now with ventricular wall 
focal hypokinesis. EF 40%. Patient initially started on Lasix, 
which was discontinued upon discharge given mild hypotension and 
euvolemia.  
. 
# CAD: Now s/p NSTEMI. Per report, pt had an MI ___ years ago. No 
ASA since large necrotic lung mass and scant hemoptysis. Patient 
changed from atenolol with sotalol and was given statin and no 
further antiplatelet therapy given large risk for bleeding and 
hemoptysis.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic, stable, likely of chronic disease in  
setting of malignancy
.
Oncologic:
# Neutropenic / Pancytopenic- No fever at this time. Patient 
became neutropenic, as expected, while in house and was given 
Neupogen for stimlation.  He was transiently on levofloxacin for 
neutropenic fever, which was subsequently discontinued after 48 
hours with no fevers and negative micro
.
# Large main bronchus obliteration - patient receiving treatment 
course of XRT to lung, which he will continue as an outpatient.
.  
# Poorly differentiated metastatic squamous lung cancer - He has 
 
metastasis to the adrenals, brain and soft tissue (jaw & back). 
Carboplatin/taxol ___. Patient did not require neupogen 
given white count. Patient was given megace to stimulate 
appetite. 
. 
# Pain control - Secondary to Metastatic R temporal leison - 
from poorly differentiated squamous lung ca s/p local XRT. 
Patient also from superficial midline thoracic back metatasis. 
No new neurologic symptoms. Patient received XRT by radiational 
oncology. Patient's pain was well controlled upon discharge.
.  
# Depression - Patient evaluated by psych, placed on citalopram. 
Patient became hyponatremic and switched to mitrazipine  

After discussion with the patient, the patient's family and the 
medical staff, all were in agreement that ___ was a 
suitable candidate for discharge.
