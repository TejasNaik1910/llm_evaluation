History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yo M with metastatic non small cell lung cancer 
(known mets to brain and on WBXRT as well as XRT to lungs) on 
decadron, returned to OSH yesterday with worsening delirium and 
jaundice, transferred here for further care. Per pts son, 2 
weeks ago pt was diagnosed with lung cancer. At this point, pt 
has been living with his son. Pt began to have hematemesis 1 
month ago, when PCP began to work him up. Pts PCP obtained ___ CXR 
and then referred pt to Dr. ___. He had a 
PET scan which showed a large brain met. He was started on 
steroids 6 days ago (decadron 4 mg four times a day for 6 days) 
prescribed by Dr. ___. Pt was started on XRT to lungs 
and WBXRT to brain (has completed ___ treatments), with plan 
for possible stereotactic surgery on brain mets and resection of 
lung cancer. One week ago, pt was ambulating, conversive, not 
confused. Two days ago, pt did not know where he was, was unable 
to walk without walking into a table, unable to feed himself, 
barely talking. Pts son noted jaundice 2 days ago (perhaps there 
2 weeks ago, but worsened) as well. Pt was taken to ___ 
___ on ___, where he was seen in the ___. He was given a 
dose of solumedrol 125 mg IV x1, and then discharged on his 
regimen of decadron again. Yesterday, pt presented again to 
___ for altered mental status, and is now transferred 
here for further input.  UA was negative. CT head noted 
hyperdense lesion R occipital lobe meaasuring 4.4 cm x 3 cm 
showing no interval change. Also, surrounding vasogenic edema 
noted around lesion. The lesion produces mass effect compressing 
the adjacent occipital horn of the R lateral ventricle. 
Previously seen hemorrhagic lesion mostly in the R occipital 
lobe is unchanged.  T Bili elevated to 5.6, D Bili 1.4, Alk Phos 
260, AST 91, ALT 103, INR 2.1, ammonia 208. Pt is unable to 
provide any history himself.
.
In the ___, the pts vitals were: T 97.7 HR 78 NP 154/65 RR 16 Sat 
97% RA. Pt was given 10 U SC insulin for ___. RUQ ultrasound 
showed an echogenic liver with 8 cm mass (?hemangioma), patent 
portal vein. He was admitted to medicine for further evaluation.

CT head OSH:
hyperdense lesion R occipital lobe meaasuring 4.4 cm x 3 cm 
showing no interval change. Also, surrounding vasogenic edema 
noted around lesion. The lesion produces mass effect compressing 
the adjacent occipital horn of the R lateral ventricle. 
Previously seen hemorrhagic lesion mostly in the R occipital 
lobe is unchanged.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Delirium/Hepatic encephalopathy: Hepatic versus other 
etiology. Although ammonia and LFTs were elevated on admission, 
pattern not consistent with alcoholic cirrhosis, considered 
micrometastases to liver. No clear signs of infection, hepatitis 
serologies only showed prior immunity. Considered effect of 
brain met and surrounding vasogenic edema although neuro-onc 
evaluation felt this was unlikely due to minimal mass effect and 
no midline shift. On discussion with hepatology, decadron and 
XRT likely overstressed pts liver, causing acute decompensation. 
He was started on aggressive lactulose and rifaxmin (initially 
required and NGT to administer this, but pulled this out within 
24 hours and as mental status was improving to the point of 
being able to take POs safely, it was not replaced), and his 
mental status gradually improved significantly.

# Non-small cell lung CA: Followed by providers at OSH: medical 
oncologist (Dr. ___ ___ who did the initial inpatient 
consultation when his diagnosis was made), radiation oncologist 
(Dr. ___ ___, thoracic surgeon (Dr. ___ at ___ 
___ ___. Initial plan was for WBXRT to brain met 
and XRT to lung nodule, with plans for Cyberknife to brain met 
(at that time, it was thought to be unresectable), then 
resection of lung nodule. Had completed 5 out of 10 sessions of 
WBXRT. Given possibility of liver mets, it was essential to 
establish whether or not there is diffuse disease elsewhere as 
this may impact decision to resect lung lesion (see below). The 
patient's family and Dr. ___ input from ___ 
heme-onc service to discuss further treatment options given his 
liver disease and hemorrhagic brain met. Thoracic surgery was 
consulted and felt the patient would not benefit for thoracic 
surgery.

# cirrhosis with possible liver mets: Cirrhosis was initially 
presumed to be from his history of heavy alcohol use, although 
the AST was not elevated more than the ALT as would be expected. 
Hepatitis panel was negative. The possibility of diffuse 
metastatic disease in the liver was considered. Micrometastases 
may be giving liver a nodular appearance on imaging, leading to 
a picture of pseudocirrhosis. Echogenic mass in liver seen on US 
was not visualized on CT because it was done without contrast 
due to contrast allergy. MRI showed a lesion in segment 6, but 
per outpatient PET-CT report from ___, nothing lit up in 
the liver, so nontargeted US-guided liver biopsy was done ___. 
This showed cirrhosis but no evidence of tumor.

# Brain metastasis: Pt has a hemorrhagic R occipital brain met. 
CT scan here of the head showed a significant amount of 
bleeding, and it wais unclear if this is increased or stable 
from prior. In setting of coagulopathy, this may have worsened. 
He has had ___ WBXRT treatments by Dr. ___, in 
___, ___. Admitted on day 7 of decadron. Discussed 
overall plan of care with Dr. ___ on admission, and 
although pts thoracic surgeon has plans for potential cure, his 
radiation oncologist does not think pt will likely be curable, 
especially now with liver decompensation. Patient's neuro 
deficit (left visual field cut) has been stable, repeat CT 24 
hours after admission as well as MRI ___ showed stable lesion. 
Dr. ___ recommended decadron taper on admission: 4 
mg tid for ___ days, then taper to 4 mg bid for ___ days, then 
taper to 4 mg daily for ___ days, then 2 mg for ___ days, and 
then 2 mg qod for ___ days. Per ___ here, no role for 
continuing WBXRT now given liver workup and possible resection 
of brain met; per discussion with Dr. ___ agrees with 
holding XRT in brain and lung for now. Neurosurgery was 
consulted and felt the mass was resectable. Dr. ___, Dr. ___, 
___ neuro-onc here (Dr. ___ all agreed to the resection, so he 
was transferred to the neurosurgery service on ___ for the 
operation which he tolerated without difficulty he was monitored 
in the PACU and was transferred to the surgical floor. He 
remained neurologically intact without any deficits.

# Coagulopathy: INR elevated, likely from liver decompensation. 
He required aggressive FFP and platelets before procedures. 
Heparin SC was held.

# Thrombocytopenia: likely from liver decompensation, splenic 
sequestration. He required platelet transfusions before 
procedures.

# splenic infarct: seen on MRI, may be related to 
hypercoagulable state from malignancy or thrombosis (cirrhotics 
may still be vulnerable to thromboses off of anticoagulation, 
but he has been ambulating), no evidence of afib to suggest that 
as an embolic source. He did not have pain or fever, and 
anticoagulation would not be started anyway because of 
hemorrhagic brain met. His symptoms were monitored.

# h/o alcoholism: Pt has h/o alcoholism, last drink 4 days PTA. 
No signs of withdrawal. He was given thiamine and folate. A ___ 
scale was ordered but he did not require any benzos.

# Dehydration: Poor po intake for several days prior to 
admission, BUN/Cr ratio elevated on admission, Hct likely 
hemoconcentrated.

# Hyperglycemia: No history of diabetes. Hyperglycemia likely 
due to decadron, although given degree of blood sugar elevation, 
he likely had an element of undiagnosed diabetes before. His 
elevated sugars may also be exacerbated by family bringing in 
outside food and greater than normal PO intake when he has not 
been NPO. Lantus and RISS were started and titrated up as 
necessary.

# Hypertension: continued metoprolol

# Macrocytosis: B12/folate normal/high

The patient was transferred to the neurosurgery service and 
underwent craniotomy for tumor resection. The surgery went well 
and he recovered in the PACU overnight. He was then transferred 
to the neurosurgery floor. The patient worked with ___ and OT who 
felt that he was unsafe to go home due to his cognitive 
deficits. Therefore he was screened for rehab. 

The patient required oxygen therapy while on the neurosurgery 
service and was unable to be weaned off. He will continue this 
at rehab. The patient will resume his radiation treatments at 
___ the lung and brain.

Thoracic surgery was consulted who felt that lung resection was 
not possible due to the stage 4 lung CA. Additionally palliative 
care was consulted who assisted in the plan for discharge to 
rehab with the daily transfer to the radiation center.
His coags were followed as his plts continued to trend down (46 
on discharge), hem onc was consulted and they did not recommend 
transfusing until it less than 10K. His INR was trending up, 
Hepatology was consulted and did not recommend reversing unless 
evidence of bleeding. On discharge his neuro exam was normal 
with a flat affect, and short term memory problems.
