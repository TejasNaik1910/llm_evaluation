IMAGING/STUDIES
===============
___ Imaging URIN CATH CHECK 
FINDINGS: 
1. Left antegrade nephrostogram shows initially poor flow 
through the tube. Moderate to severe hydronephrosis with no flow 
towards the ureter. 
2. Appropriate final position of Left nephrostomy tube. 
IMPRESSION:  
Technically successful Left 8 ___ nephrostomy exchange. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of 
advanced prostate cancer metastatic to the liver with peritoneal 
carcinamatosis with recent admission s/p left PCN tube placement 
on ___ who presents for management of his obstructed left PCN 
tube.

#LEFT HYDRONEPHROSIS:
#LEFT-SIDED FLANK PAIN:
#ABSENT NEPHROSTOMY TUBE OUTPUT: Patient presented with absent 
left PCN tube output x24hrs. Drain study by ___ showed poor flow 
through the tube, likely due to kinking of the tube, with 
moderate to severe hydronephrosis with no flow towards the 
ureter. He had successful left 8 ___ nephrostomy exchange on 
___. Consistent drainage of clear yellow urine to bag since 
the time of tube change. Continued pain control with home 
oxycontin and oxycodone.

#ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Cr 3.1 on admission with baseline appears 
1.3-1.5. Likely post-renal secondary to PCN obstruction. Cr 
improving s/p ___ PCN replacement + IVF (Cr 1.7 at the time of 
discharge).

#PYURIA:
#LEUKOCYTOSIS: Leukocytosis likely related to recent Neulasta 
(___). However, also with bandemia, which is less 
characteristic of Neulasta. No fevers or other signs/symptoms of 
infection, aside from pyuria. UA drawn from nephrostomy with 
positive leuks and > 182 WBCs but negative nitrite and only few 
bacteria. No fevers or signs/symptoms of UTI. Given dose of 
zosyn in ED (___), and started on ceftriaxone on the floor. 
Received 2 doses (___). On the day of discharge, urine 
culture was finalized, and did not grow any bacteria. Discharged 
off antibiotics.

#MALIGNANT ASCITES
#NAUSEA/VOMITING: Paracentesis on ___ with 3.5L removed, 
fluid studies consistent with malignant cells. Suspect 
nausea/vomiting is the result of abdominal distension, liver 
mets. Continued Zofran/Compazine.

#DVT: Recently LLE DVT but was told not an anticoagulation 
candidate due to GIB. Patient reports had filter placed several 
weeks ago at ___.

#METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER: Known to have liver mets and 
carcinomatosis. Per Dr. ___ condition is terminal and 
prognosis is quite poor. Started on cabazitaxel last admission. 
Due to follow-up with Dr ___ on ___. Started on Ritalin 
2.5mg daily for appetite stimulation.

#HYPERTENSION: Patient discharged off lisinopril/on amlodipine 
but had recently restarted lisinopril after discharge. Continued 
amlodipine 5mg daily.

#ANEMIA: Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic 
inflammation. No evidence of active bleeding.

#CONSTIPATION: Likely secondary from narcotics. Continued home 
bowel regimen (senna/Colace/Miralax).

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#PCN TUBE: already has ___ established for this. Scheduled for 
tube exachange with ___ in ___.
#BP MEDS: discharged OFF lisinopril, ON amlodipine 5mg daily
#ONCOLOGY FOLLOW-UP: with Dr ___ on ___.
#RITALIN: started on Ritalin 2.5mg daily for appetite 
stimulation. Can uptitrate as outpatient, if needed.
#CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

You were admitted to ___ from 
___ - ___ for low urine output through your nephrostomy 
tube.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You had you nephrostomy tube exchanged for a new one. The 
Interventional Radiology team suspects that your old tube was 
kinked, and this is why there was little-to-no urine output into 
the bag.
- You had blood work and a urine study when you first arrived 
that was concerning for a urinary tract infection. We gave you a 
few days of antibiotics, but ultimately your urine grew no 
bacteria, so we stopped antibiotics. It is possible that the 
abnormal blood work and urine study were due to irritation 
caused by the blocked nephrostomy tube.
- You were found to have an injury to your kidney, as evidenced 
by your blood work. This was likely due to the fact that your 
nephrostomy tube was not allowing your kidney to drain. Your 
kidney function improved rapidly with IV fluids, and with a new 
nephrostomy tube that allowed for drainage of the urine from 
your kidney.
- You were started on a new medication, methylphenidate 
(Ritalin), to help stimulate your appetite.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- You will follow-up with Dr ___ in the clinic on ___ 
(see below or details).
- You may continue to take Ritalin, if you find it effective. 
You can discuss the medication with Dr ___ you do not feel 
like it is effective in increasing your appetite.
- A couple of notes about management of your nephrostomy tube, 
to prevent this kinking from happening again:
  - Be very careful to avoid bumping the tube against things, or 
putting the tube in an odd position when sitting or lying down,
  - When you sleep, ensure that the bag and tube are BELOW the 
level of your heart. This will allow the tube to keep draining 
freely throughout the night, which will prevent stagnant urine 
from pooling in the tube and causing problems.
  - Do NOT take lisinopril. This medication can sometimes cause 
injury to your kidneys, which we would like to avoid. We have 
replaced this medication with amlodipine, which you should 
continue to take to control your blood pressure.

We wish you the very best with your health going forward.

Your ___ Oncology Team
