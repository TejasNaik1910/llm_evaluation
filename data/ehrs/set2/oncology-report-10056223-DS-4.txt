Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with ___ EtOH and HCV cirrhosis, 
c/b ascites and variceal bleed, recent MRI with lesions 
concerning for HCC, who was admitted s/p RFA and liver biopsy 
for pain control, found to have a right hemothorax.  
.
ACUTE CARE:
#Hemothorax: Following RFA, patient was admitted for pain 
control and drowsiness. He was short of breath with an oxygen 
requirement. He was found to have a hemothorax, and a chest tube 
was placed draining 2 liters of bloody fluid. The tube was 
removed two days later and there was ___ recurrence of hemothorax 
on discharge.
.  
#. s/p RFA: Patient was originally hypotensive and dizzy 
following procedure and was managed on PCA and nadolol held. 
After a few days patient was transitioned to PO oxycodone for 
post-procedure pain and nadolol was re-started. Patient's 
orthostatic vital signs and ambulatory oxygen sats were normal 
on discharge.
.
# Intermittant fevers: Patient had intermittant fever following 
RFA. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and ascitic fluid analysis 
showed ___ signs of infection. Fevers were likely secondary to 
post-procedure inflammation and atelectasis.

CHRONIC CARE:
Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: compensated cirrhosis, on nadolol for 
variceal bleed ppx. 
 
HCC: Patient tolerated the procedure with the post-op course 
involving hemothorax and fevers. Chemo-embolization is required 
for a second focus of HCC based on the position of the tumor.

TRANSITIONS IN CARE:
Final read on blood, urine, and ascitic fluid cultures are 
pending on discharge.
Patient will require chemo-embolization procedure to treat a 
different site of HCC.
Patient was listed as full code in the hospital, and his sister 
was listed as contact.
