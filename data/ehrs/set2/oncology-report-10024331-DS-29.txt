Renal Ultrasound:  
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.5 cm. The left kidney 
measures 11.1 cm. In the interpolar region of the right kidney, 
there is a small 1.4 x 1.4 x 1.3 cm cystic-appearing lesion with 
thin mildly vascular internal septation. No associated internal 
nodularity. Cyst appears relatively unchanged compared to ___ CT. In the upper pole of the left kidney, there is a 
mildly lobulated avascular cystic-appearing lesion with possible 
peripheral septations. The lesion measures 2.1 x 3.4 x 2.24 cm 
and is overall unchanged in ___ compared to prior CT. In 
the lower pole of the left kidney, there is a small cystic 
lesion measuring 1.9 x 1.5 x 1.8 cm which also appears stable 
compared to abdominal CT. In the bladder, there is a lobulated 
filling defect noted to change morphology with patient motion. 
Filling defect likely represents debris, possibly due to blood 
clot particularly given patient's gross hematuria. Although 
occasional internal color doppler signal was noted, this was not 
confirmed with pulsed Doppler evaluation and likely related to 
motion artifact. The patient's Foley catheter was flushed during 
evaluation and frank blood clots were evacuated. Post-flush 
imaging demonstrated a compressed bladder with apparently 
decreased filling defect. Given level of debris, the posterior 
bladder wall is not well seen and it would not be possible to 
exclude a mass in this region if this is of clinical concern.  
IMPRESSION:  
1. Stable cystic lesions noted in the right upper pole, left 
upper pole and left lower pole of the kidneys.  
2. Irregular filling defect in bladder likely represents blood 
clot.  
Posterior bladder wall is not well evaluated due to the presence 
of this likely clot.  
.  
Lower extremity ultrasound:  
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left or 
right lower extremities.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to participate in your care Mr. ___. You were 
admitted to the hospital with blood in your urine.  The bleeding 
was likely caused by having a foley catherer in your bladder. 
Your bladder is more likely to bleed because of the radiation 
you had for prostate cancer. The urologists saw you and 
irrigated your bladder.  The bleeding improved and you were able 
to urinate on your own.

You must continue to make your aspirin and plavix every day.  Do 
not stop taking this medication without permission from Dr. 
___. 

We increased your dose of lasix to 40 mg daily because of your 
lower extremity swelling. 

Please see below for your follow-up appointments.
