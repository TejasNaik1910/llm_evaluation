History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ yo M with smoking history, chronic alcoholism and 
chronic back pain who presents with subacute progressive right 
lower extremity pain, numbness and profound weakness on a 
background of chronic low back pain and right lumbar 
radiculopathy.

Regarding his lower back pain he explains that he fell off a 
truck several year ago and since that time has been plagued by 
low back pain and intermittent sciatica. 

Around ___ he suffered a fall during which he hurt 
his lower back and at that time noticed that his right leg felt 
somewhat weak with some slight numbness. He was having some back 
pain that radiated down the right leg and felt that his weakness 
at that time was related to his pain. 

Over the next 2 months though, his right leg continued to get 
weak and he began having difficulty ambulating eventually 
requiring the assistance of his family to move around. During 
this time he and his family felt that the weakness seemed out of 
proportion to the pain. 

Because of his issues with mobility he eventually went to see 
his orthopedic doctor last week who, given the description of 
symptoms, ordered an MRI of the lumbar spine which was scheduled 
for this ___ (in 2 days). However his weakness continued to 
progress at a rather fast pace and he is now unable to get out 
of bed alone and has very little if any movement in the right 
leg.
He has fallen twice over the past 48hrs because as his daughter 
explains he forgets or doesnt admit to the extent of the 
weakness in his leg and falls out of bed at night. Earlier today 
they called his office and at that point were refered to the ED 
for further workup. Neurology was then consulted.

He denies incontinence of urine or stool. The pain in his back 
is moderate and continues to radiate down the posterior aspect 
of his right leg. 

Patient does not have a personal history of cancer but endorses 
unintentional weight loss (5lbs), night sweats (at least for 
past several weeks, because of this measured his temperature and 
found nightly low grade fevers). He does complain of a 
productive continuous cough over the past 2.5months. Denies 
head/neck pain.  

On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred 
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, 
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties 
producing or comprehending speech.  No bowel or bladder 
incontinence or retention.

******************
IMAGING:
CT HEAD ___: 
1.  Two foci of vasogenic edema in the left corona radiata and 
centrum semiovale.  Central hyperdensities make these suspicious 
for underlying masses.  Further characterization with enhanced 
MRI is recommended. 
2.  Maxillary sinus inflammatory disease. 
.
MR SPINE ___:
1.  No evidence of osseous or epidural metastatic disease in the 
cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine, within the limits of 
non-contrast MRI.
2.  Multilevel degenerative disease in the cervical, thoracic, 
and lumbar 
spine.   
3.  Severe spinal canal narrowing with compression of the spinal 
cord at 
C3-C4. Moderate spinal canal narrowing with abutment of the 
spinal cord at C5-C6. Questionable abnormal signal in the 
cervical cord, versus artifacts. If cervical myelopathy is 
suspected clinically, then a dedicated MRI of the cervical 
spine, with the field of view targeted for detailed evaluation 
of the cervical spine, would be helpful for reassessment.
4.  Severe multilevel neural foraminal narrowing, and 
subarticular recess narrowing, in the lumbar spine, with 
impingement of multiple exiting and traversing nerve roots, as 
detailed above.  
5.  Apparent mass in the lower pole of the right kidney.  
Recommend abdominal/pelvic CT or renal MRI for further 
evaluation. 
.
MRI HEAD ___: 
1.  Two small masses in the left cerebral hemisphere with 
associated vasogenic edema, most suggestive of metastatic 
disease.  The left centrum semiovale mass may contain chronic 
blood products.   
2.  Chronic microhemorrhage in the centrum semiovale at the 
level of the left paracentral lobule, in an area of vasogenic 
edema, but not directly corresponding to the left parafalcine 
mass, which may be related to underlying hypertension or other 
etiology.   
3.  Fluid in the left maxillary sinus and extensive left ethmoid 
air cell opacification.  Fluid in the left concha bullosa.  
Please correlate clinically whether the patient has symptoms of 
acute sinusitis. 
.
TESTICULAR ULTRASOUND ___: Normal testicular ultrasound.
.
CT TORSO ___: 
1. Necrotic right renal mass with perinephric stranding.  
Superinfection of the mass is not excluded.  The renal artery 
branch supplying the lower pole is expanded and may be 
thrombosed.   
2. Lingular nodule representing metastasis or a primary lung 
cancer.   
3. Small hypodense lesions in the liver may be cysts, but are 
not fully characterized.  
4. Indeterminate left adrenal nodule.   
5. 10-mm right paracaval lymph node.   
6. Gallstone.   
7. Calcified pleural plaques suggesting prior asbestos exposure. 
  
8. Multiple old rib fractures. 
Pathology
Touch prep of kidney biopsy ___:
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent with carcinoma.  
.
R kidney biopsy ___
Renal cell carcinoma with oncocytic features.  See note.
Note:  PAX-2, CA-9 and P504S are positive; CK7 and CK20 are 
positive as well but much more focally; p63 and TTF-1 are 
negative.  This immunophenotype supports the diagnosis of a 
renal primary and is compatible with a conventional/clear cell 
carcinoma with a marked granular component; one additional 
immunostain will be sent as an addendum.  
.
___     SPINAL FLUID  cytology pending

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man with HTN, COPD and significant 
smoking/alcohol history who present with progressive right sided 
weakness and right lower back pain. He was found to have 2 left 
sided brain masses and a large right renal mass, as well as a 
smaller lingular mass. 
.
# Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: Patient was found to have 
multiple mets, 2 to brain and lingula and it was thought to be 
from the large right necrotic renal mass seen on CT of torso. 
For the work up of his renal mass, medical oncology and urology 
were consulted and recommended ___ guided renal biopsy. The 
biopsy showed renal cell carcinoma. Pt has been referred to 
multi-disciplinary renal cancer clinic for evaluation and 
discussion of treatment options. He will see ___, NP 
with either Dr. ___ Dr. ___ oncology) as well 
as Dr. ___ on ___ at 4pm. Pt's daughters 
plan to accompany his to this visit.
.
# Brain mets: Likely causing his right leg and arm weakness 
given the location of the lesions. Given the significant edema 
surrounding the masses, he was started on dexamethasone. He was 
continued on a PPI and started on trazodone PRN insomnia and 
insulin sliding scale. He was seen by radiation oncology and 
neuro-onc as an inpatient. Dr. ___ Radiation ___ 
plans to perform stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the brain 
lesions, which will be done as an outpatient.  
Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) was done to look for evidence of 
leptomeningeal spread, but cytology was pending at the time of 
discharge. Mr. ___ will continue on dexamethasone at 
discharge. If he is going to be on steroids past ___, PCP 
(infection) prophylaxis with Bactrim should be started. Calcium 
and vitamin D supplementation should also be started.
.
# Cervical/lumbar stenosis: Patient was found to have 
significant cervical stenosis on the MRI of whole spine, 
especially in the level of C3-C4. On examination, there was 
evidence of some left sided weakness as well in L deltoid and 
iliopsoas, possibly from his cervical stenosis. However, there 
was no increased tone and no increased reflexes, so the extent 
of myelopathy is unclear, especially in setting of significant 
weakness in the right leg likely from the brain mass. 
.
# Alcoholism: History of at least 6 beers a day as outpatient, 
started on CIWA score in house and did not score, so this was 
d/ced on HD5. There was no evidence of alcohol withdrawal in 
house. LFTs were checked and were wnl, with albumin of 3.4.
.
# Hypertension: Elevated blood pressure on admission, restarted 
all of his home medications including atenolol, furosemide, and 
hydralazine with improved control of his blood pressure. 
.
# COPD: continued on home Spiriva  and fluticasone inhaler with 
albuterol nebs PRN. He can resume an albuterol inhaler as 
needed. 
.
# Insomnia: Difficulty sleeping, likely related to steroids. 
Patient was given a dose of Ambien which made him see crawling 
bugs on his arm. Ambien was discontinued and listed as an 
allergy. He tolerated trazodone without any adverse reactions. 
.
