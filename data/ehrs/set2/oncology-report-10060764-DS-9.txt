Renal us: IMPRESSION: 1. Slightly echogenic normal-sized 
kidneys, likely related to medical renal disease.  No evidence 
of hydronephrosis.  2. Suspected tiny calculus within a 
hydrocalyx in the upper pole right kidney. 3. Partially 
visualized perihepatic and pelvic free fluid.

ERCP: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: The 3 previously placed metal biliary stents were 
found in good position at the major papilla. The right and left 
metal biliary stents were found within the larger common bile 
duct metal stent. Evidence of tumor burden was again seen at the 
opening of the distal end of the stents.
Cannulation: Cannulation of the biliary duct within the right 
and left metal biliary stents was successful and deep with a 
balloon using a free-hand technique. Cannulation of the common 
bile duct metal stent was not performed.
Fluoroscopic Interpretation of Biliary Tree: The wire and 
extraction balloon were first advanced within the metal stent in 
the right biliary system above the level of the upper opening of 
the stent. Limited cholangiogram of the right biliary system 
above this level appeared normal. Multiple balloon sweeps were 
performed with extraction of large amounts of sludge and stone 
debris. The wire and extraction balloon were then advanced 
within the metal stent in the left biliary system. They could 
not be advanced above the upper opening of the stent. Contrast 
injection also did not pass above this level into the left 
biliary system, suggesting complete obstruction at the upper 
level of the stent. Multiple balloon sweeps were performed with 
extraction of large amounts of sludge and stone debris.

Impression: 3 previous metal biliary stents at the major 
papilla: the right and left metal biliary stents were within the 
common bile duct metal stent. Evidence of tumor burden at the 
distal opening of the stents. Successful biliary cannulation 
within the right and left metal biliary stents. Cannulation of 
the common bile duct metal stent was not performed. The wire and 
extraction balloon were first advanced within the metal stent in 
the right biliary system above the level of the upper opening of 
the stent. Limited cholangiogram of the right biliary system 
above this level appeared normal. Multiple balloon sweeps were 
performed with extraction of large amounts of sludge and stone 
debris. The wire and extraction balloon were then advanced 
within the metal stent in the left biliary system. They could 
not be advanced above the upper opening of the stent. Contrast 
injection also did not pass above this level into the left 
biliary system, suggesting complete obstruction at the upper 
level of the stent. Multiple balloon sweeps were performed with 
extraction of large amounts of sludge and stone debris. 
Otherwise normal ERCP to third part of the duodenum.

ERCP: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: The 3 previously placed metal biliary stents were 
found in good position at the major papilla. The right and left 
metal biliary stents were found within the larger common bile 
duct metal stent. The recently placed PTBD was also in good 
position within 1 of these metal stents. Evidence of tumor 
burden was again seen at the opening of the distal end of the 
stents.
Cannulation: Cannulation of the biliary duct within what 
appeared to be the left metal biliary stent was successful and 
deep with a balloon using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium 
was injected resulting in complete opacification. Cannulation of 
the other stents was technically challenging and could not be 
completed.
Fluoroscopic Interpretation of Biliary Tree: The wire and 
extraction balloon were advanced within the left metal biliary 
stent to above the level of the upper opening of the stent. 
Limited cholangiogram of the left biliary system above this 
level appeared normal. Multiple balloon sweeps 
Procedures: An 8mm x 80mm WallFlex Biliary RX uncovered metal 
stent (Ref: ___ was placed successfully in the 
left main hepatic duct above the level of the previously placed 
left metal biliary stent. There was excellent flow of bile at 
the end of the procedure.

PTBD:  IMPRESSION: 1. Successful replacement of a partially 
dislodged 8 ___ internal-external biliary drain with a new 10 
___ internal external biliary drain. 2.  Balloon plasty of 
the interstices of the left metallic biliary stent. 

Cholangiogram: FINDINGS: 1. Transabdominal ultrasound showing 
dilated bile ducts and a small amount of perihepatic ascites. 2. 
 Cholangiogram showing narrowing inside the central opening of 
the left hepatic duct stent. 3.  Normal flow of contrast through 
the left hepatic duct stent following balloon dilatations. 4.  
Appropriately positioned destrung left hepatic 8 ___ 
percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheter in 
appropriate position. IMPRESSION: Successful balloon dilatation 
of a central left hepatic duct stricture with placement of a new 
destrung 8 ___ internal/external left PTBD.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with HTN, afib on warfarin, nonresectable cholangiocarcinoma 
s/p chemo/XRT who was trasnferred for abdominal pain, jaudice, 
transaminitis with CT scan showing stent occlusion. She 
underwent multiple ERCPs and interventional radiology procedures 
with no improvement with her labs or symptoms. After discussion 
with her inpatient and outpatient providers, and discussion with 
patient and family, the patient was made focus on comfort 
measures and was discharged with hospice care.

# Cholangiocarcinoma:
# Goals of care:
The patient has cholangiocarcinoma with ERCP imaging suggestive 
of tumor burden. After multiple failed interventions her 
transaminitis failed to improve. This was thought to be 
(although not definitively proved to be) due to 
cholangiocarcinoma progression. Given her cancer, failure to 
improve, prolonged hospilization, and desire to be home with her 
family, a family meeting was had to discuss further options. Per 
her outpatient oncologist, no further treatment options were 
available for her cholangiocarcinoma. She decided to transition 
to focus on comfort measures only and was made DNR/DNI with the 
support of her family. She was discharged with hospice care.

# Bile duct obstruction:
# Presumed cholangitis:
She had evidence of stent occlusion. Multiple interventions were 
done with clearance of the stent, however, bilirubin failed to 
improve. She was empirically started on unasyn. She completed a 
course of unasyn without improvement in LFTs or WBC. After 
discussion with ERCP and ___, they felt that no further 
interventions were likely to be successful. Tumor progression 
was thought to be the cause of the continued transaminitis.

# Abdominal pain:
She was treated with oxycodone which was then changed to liquid 
concentrated morphine upon discharge. In addition, she is on an 
H2 blocker, PPI, simethicone for symptomatic relief. Hospice 
care will continue to titrate her pain regimen as her pain is 
expected to continue given her cancer.

# Constipation: 
She was placed on a bowel regimen. She was moving her bowels but 
as her pain regimen is titrated this may need to be adjusted as 
well.

# Acute renal failure:
This was thought to be due to pre-renal causes. She was treated 
with IV fluids with improvement in kidney function.

# Atrial fibrillation:
# Supratherapeutic INR:
This was likely a combination of nutritional and warfarin use. 
She was given vitamin K. Once she was made CMO, warfarin was 
discontinued. She was continued on digoxin for rate control as 
she feels uncomfortable with tachycardia.

# Malnutrition:
She has low albumin and difficulty eating significant amounts of 
food. She was supplemented with ensure clear. No restrictions on 
her diet at discharge but she may tolerate low fat foods better 
given her biliary issues.

# Lower extremity edema:
This was thought to be related to poor nutrition and low oncotic 
pressure. Diuresis was attempted but resulted in acute renal 
failure.

# Leukocytosis:
No clear evidence of infection. She received an empiric course 
of unasyn. After discontinuation there was no change in WBC. No 
fevers. Urine and blood cultures negative. If fevers develop, it 
may be reasonable to consider empiric antibiotics IF it provides 
comfort for the patient. This management will be deferred to 
hospice care. It was discussed with the patient and family.

# Anemia: 
Likely of nutritional and chronic disease. Trended as inpatient. 
Given comfort measures no treatment necessary.

# Physical activity: 
Ambulation with a rolling walker. Home ___. Home needs assessment 
to be done by hospice.

Her outpatient oncologist and primary care physician were 
notified of change in goals of care.

Transitional issues:
- hospice care - home services
- pain control
- consider home ___
- consider empiric ciprofloxacin for evidence of infection for 
patient comfort -- if necessary -- for presumed cholangitis - 
she is at high risk of developing cholangitis given her biliary 
anatomy
