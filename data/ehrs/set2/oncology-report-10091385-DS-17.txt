Brief Hospital Course:
___ F liver mass and omental implants on CT scan,  s/p liver 
biopsy ___ which were negative, followed by biopsy of liver 
mass and L pelvic mass on ___, which demonstrated only 
inflammatory cells without carcinoma represented with fever and 
RUQ pain. She was pan-cultured and CT scanned. CT demonstrated 
new lobulated hypodensities in the region of the ill-defined 
mass in the right lobe of the liver 
concerning for abscesses. The hepatic mass seemed slightly 
bigger, right portal vein branch thrombus was unchanged and 
there was slight enlargement of the peritoneal soft tissue 
nodules.  In the anterior midline of the pelvis, along the left 
lower quadrant peritoneal implants, there was a new 2.6 cm rim 
enhancing low density fluid collection, also concerning for an 
abscess. She was started on Vancomycin in the ED, however, she 
developed s/o allergic reaction (subjective throat swelling and 
rash). She was treated with Benadryl and antibiotics were 
changed to Zosyn and Flagyl. 

Daily surveillance cultures were sent. She continued to be 
febrile. On ___, she underwent U/S-guided percutaneous drainage 
of right hepatic fluid collection with bloody material aspirated 
consistent with hematoma possibly related to the recent biopsy. 
Fluid was sent for culture. Gram stain showed 4+ PMN with 2+ 
gram positive rods. Culture was negative and acid fast smear was 
negative. Acid fast culture was not finalized. Admission blood 
and urine cultures were negative. Subsequent blood cultures were 
negative to date and un finalized. 

On ___, a repeat ultrasound was done showing resolution of the 
abscess. Therefore, the drain was removed. She had been 
requiring Dilaudid for pain at the drain site. Pain was much 
less after drain removal. 

ID was consulted and recommended w/u for pathogens like liver 
flukes and mycobacteria as well as EBV. Given prominence of 
plasma cells on pathology, concern for non-infectious processes 
was raised. Possible diagnoses such as inflammatory pseudotumor, 
inflammatory myofibroblastic or follicular dendritic cell tumor 
were amongst the differentials.  Allergy/immunology were 
consulted and a f/u appointment arranged for ___ with Dr. 
___.  She will undergo a repeat ultrasound on ___ to assess 
for interval change. In addition, recommendations per ID were to 
switch to oral ciprofloxacin and Flagyl with stop date of ___. 

At the time of discharge, she was afebrile with stable vital 
signs. She was ambulatory and voiding freely.  She did have mild 
pain in the RUQ near her biopsy site however this was improving.
