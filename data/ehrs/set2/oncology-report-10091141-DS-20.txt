Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old female with multiple comorbidities 
who presented with a swollen, tender, warm left knee. 
.
Hospital course by problem:
.
# Septic Arthritis: On arrival to the ED, the patient was 
afebrile (T 98.4) with a blood pressure of 144/40.  Physical 
exam was notable for a swollen left knee that was exquisitely 
tender to palpation.  Arthrocentesis revealed 15 cc of cloudy, 
viscous fluid with 129,000 WBC, >90% polys.  Gram stain did not 
reveal any organisms.  Crystals were not detected.  She received 
vancomycin for a presumed septic joint and was taken to the 
operating room for arthrotomy and drain placement.  She was 
started on ceftriaxone on ___ for potential gonococcal 
infection.  Lyme serology was negative for lyme antibody.  
Tissue cultures and swab cultures did not reveal organisms on 
gram stain and showed no anaerobic growth to date as well as no 
fungal or acid fast bacilli.  Blood cultures have not grown 
anything to date. The patient has remained afebrile throughout 
her hospital stay and without leukocytosis. ID was consulted, 
and recommended continuing vancomycin for a ___eftriaxone was stopped on ___.  The patient reports that her 
knee pain is less than when she arrived.  She is able to move 
her left knee without significant pain and has been working with 
physical therapy.  She was followed by orthopedics, who were 
pleased with her recovery.  Extensive discussion was given 
regarding repeat thoracentesis prior to discharge, but patient 
had good range of motion at the joint and felt pain had improved 
since admission, and it was uncelar what diagnostic benefit 
would be gained from a second thoracentesis.  Patient developed 
thrombocytopenia prior to discharge that was thought possibly 
___ to vancomycin.  Vancomycin was initially continued given it 
was the optimal agent and patient had other possible agents 
(such as famotidine) that may have contributed to 
thrombocytopenia.  Hematology was consulted and felt 
thrombocytopenia was more likely related to marrow suppression 
than vancomycin toxicity, and vanco was continued.  She was 
monitored for several days and showed no progression of her 
thrombocytopenia on vancomycin.  The decision was made to 
continue vancomycin and to monitor her paltelets as an 
outpatient.
- Would consider further thoracentesis if patient experiences 
increasing pain and swelling, or difficulty with range of 
motion.  Do anticipate some pain/swelling from post-operative 
changes.
- Patient will follow-up with PCP and ___ 
levels to be monitored at HD.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient with chronic mild thrombocytopenia 
and history of HIT - although no documented work-up in BI 
system.  Patient became progressively thrombocytopenic in house, 
and immediately prior to initial discharge had significant drop 
in platelets to 50's.  Patient was held in house for a further 5 
days, and was without further decrease in her platelets.  No 
bleeding complications.  Medical record was very carefully 
examined and patient had no known exposure to heparin during 
this hospitalization.  Further, the decrease in platelets was 
felt not to be typical of HIT or reactivation of HIT in 
previously exposed patient.  DIC work-up also non-revealing.  
Hematology was consulted who felt decrease was not likely HIT, 
and ultimately decided it was due to marrow suppression from 
infection.  Evidence for vancomycin toxicity was felt to be 
minimal as time course did not fit appropriately.  Plan on 
discharge is as follows:
- Please check platelet count twice weekly at hemodialysis
- If platelets drop below 30K patient should be referred to 
hospital for evaluation.
- Continue vancomycin for 6 weeks as long as platelet count 
stable.
- Patient to follow-up with Hematology if thrombocytopenia 
persists after completion of her course of vancomycin.
.
# Allergic reaction/angioedema: After the 
arthrotomy/synovectomy, the patient's daughter noticed her face 
was more swollen than normal.  She was was exposed to 
vancomycin, morphine, and anesthetic agents during the 
arthrotomy. It is not clear which agents may have contributed to 
the swollen state, and whether her swelling was an allergic 
reaction at all or fluid accumulation in setting of not being 
dialyzed.  She was transferred from medicine and monitored in 
the PACU.  She did not appear to have any respiratory 
compromise, and there was no stridor on exam. She did not 
complain of throat tightness or tongue swelling. She did 
complain of throat discomfort, which was felt to be related to 
her recent intubation. She was given diphenhydramine 12.5 IV 
q8hrs, famotidine 40 mg PO bid, and she received 
methylprednisolone once, though this was not continued given her 
history of DM1 and likely septic joint. She was monitored in the 
ICU overnight. Her ACEI was held. She became more alert and 
oriented, was able to speak, drink, and swallow without problem, 
so she was called out to the floor.  On the medicine floor, the 
patient did not exhibit any episodes of facial swelling or 
oropharyngeal discomfort.  ACE was restarted on the floor prior 
to discharge without difficulty.  Facial swelling resolved with 
dialysis and may have been due to volume overload rather than 
angioedema.  Furthermore, question whether there may be a 
component of central vein stenosis as patient had 
brachiocephalic veing - SVC stenosis that was dilated by ___.
.
# Nonresponsiveness at hemodialysis:  The patient became 
transiently hypotensive to the ___ and briefly non-responsive on 
___.  The session was stopped and she was monitored in the ICU. 
 She did not have any other episodes of non-responsiveness, 
though she does have a long history of these events at 
hemodialysis sessions.  She remained normotensive on the medical 
floor throughout her stay.
.  
# End stage renal disease on hemodialysis: Patient had an 
episode of hypotension and nonresponsiveness, as described 
above. Her schedule is T, Th, ___.  She recieved erythropoietin. 
 Cinacalcet was also administered for calcium control.  
Cinacalcet was discontinued prior to discharge due to 
hypocalcemia.  Tunnelled dialysis catheter removed in house.  
Some residual swelling after removal, evaluated with ultrasound 
that showed a small hematoma.  Continue to followed clinically 
and was stable prior to discharge.
.
#Breast Swelling: patient noted her breast to be swollen.  Given 
history of untreated breast cancer on Arimidex concern was for 
progression of malignancy.  Oncology recommended outpatient 
mammogram/USD for further evaluation.  Swelling improved with 
dilation of brachiocephalic - SVC stenosis by ___, and exam was 
otherwise unremarkable.
- Outpatient follow-up as outlined.
.
# Type 1 diabetes mellitus: Remained stable.  She was continued 
on insulin NPH 10 bid and a humalog sliding scale.  Had some 
elevated finger sticks during the day and so AM NPH was 
increased to 12 units qAM.
.  
# Hypertension: Remained stable.  The ACE inhibitor was held 
until after hemodialysis on those days to decrease the risk of 
hypotension during these sessions.
.  
## CAD: Patient not takin aspirin (due to bleeding), metoprolol 
or statin as an outpatient.  Continued on ACE inhibitor as 
above.
.  
## Gout: She was continued on allopurinol ___ every other day.  
Acute monoarthritis felt not c/w gouty flare.
.  
## Atrial fibrillation:  Remained in sinus rhythm, not 
anticoagulated given low CHADS Score (2), history of HIT and not 
anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation on admission.
.  
## Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine 25  
.
## FEN/Lytes: NPO for now, cardiac, renal diet in a.m., replete 
lytes prn  
.  
## Prophylaxis: No heparin given allergy, pneumoboots  
.  
## Access: PIVs  
.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of left knee 
pain.  It was found that you had an infection in your knee.  You 
will need to take antibiotics for a full 4 week course to treat 
this infection.  You also had an evaluation of your AV fistula 
that showed a narrowing.  This narrowing (or stenosis) was 
opened up with a balloon to improve flow in your graft.  
Finally, there was some concern you may have had an allergic 
reaction after going to the Operating Room.  This reaction was 
likely related to the anesthetic agents used in the Operating 
Room, and did not appear to be related to your BP medications 
which were restarted prior to discharge without any difficulty.
.
Please call your doctor or return to the Emergency Department if 
you have any fevers, increasing knee pain, or any other 
complaint concerning to you.
