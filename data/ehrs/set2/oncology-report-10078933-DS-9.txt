CT Neck with Contrast ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Extensive hypodense material surrounding the trachea 
posteriorly and 
laterally causing anterior displacement and mild narrowing of 
the trachea 
superior to the stoma. This appears more prominent than the 
prior study, on which it was incompletely evaluated. The 
material appears most likely to represent a fluid collection, 
perhaps an absces. However, indurated edematous soft tissue 
related to surgery or infection is an alternative. 
2. Post-tracheostomy. 

MRI Soft Tissue Neck, with and w/o contrast  ___
IMPRESSION:  
1. Complex heterogeneous signal posterior and lateral 
surrounding the proxial trachea in neck demonstrating mild high 
T2 signal, dark T1 signal and enhancement on postcontrast T1 
sequences. Again noted there is anterior displacement and mild 
narrowing of the trachea. Differential diagnosis include 
infection, fibrosis or a neoplastic process. 
  
2. T1 hypointense lesion of T3 vertebral body which appears to 
enhancing on postcontrast T1 and suspicious for neoplasia. 
Dedicated MR of the spine with contrast and STIR sequences is 
suggested for further evaluation.

US Guided Biopsy of the Neck ___
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated 18-gauge core biopsy x 2 of the dense 
mass in the left side of neck encasing the left carotid artery.  

Samples were deemed adequate by realtime pathology assessment.  
Samples were sent for pathology and microbiological assessment. 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with a history of breast 
cancer status post radiation complicated by esophageal 
strictures and tracheal stenosis, status post multiple 
dilations, who was directly admitted from Interventional 
Pulmonology clinic because of CT scan results suspicious for 
posterior pharyngeal collection. She was admitted to a medical 
floor.  Teams participating in her care included Interventional 
Pulmonology, ENT, and medicine.  Her hospital course by problem 
is as follows:
  
# Posterior Pharyngeal Collection: MRI on ___ indicated a 
differential diagnosis of post-surgical fibrosis vs infection vs 
neoplastic process.  On ___ an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the 
neck with rapid cytology analysis showed results most consistent 
with malignant tumor cells.  Final pathology reports are 
pending. She will follow up as an outpatient with Dr. ___ 
___ of ENT and with her oncologist Dr. ___ for 
further evaluation and treatment of this neoplasm. 
.  
# Superventricular tachycardia (SVT).  She was monitored on 
telemetry throughout her hospitalization.  She experienced one 
brief episode of SVT which self-resolved.  She continued her 
home regimen of Verapamil.  
.
# Hypothyroidism: She was asymptomatic, and continued her home 
regimen of Levothyroxine.
.  
# Tracheal stenosis.  She was given continuous humidified air, 
and nutrition by Two Cal HN Full strength tube feeds according 
to her home feeding schedule.  
.  
# Hypertension:  She was normotensive and continued her home 
regimen of Verapamil.

# Anxiety: She was quite anxious during this hospitalization, 
especially prior to procedures and after receiving the results 
of the biopsy.  She continued her home dose of Lorazepam and 
received additional 0.5mg doses prior to procedures.  PRN Valium 
was also added to her regimen given her increased anxiety with 
this new diagnosis of likely recurrent metastatic breast cancer. 
  
.
# URI: Prior to this hospitalization she experienced an upper 
respiratory infection with symptoms of chest congestion and 
cough.  Her primary care physician started ___ regimen of 
Doxycycline with a Prednisone taper.  We continued this regimen 
as prescibed by her PCP.

Discharge Instructions:
Thank you for allowing us to take part in your care.  You were 
admitted to ___ after being 
seen in pulmonary clinic on ___. A CT scan was obtained which 
showed a collection of fluid and tissue. You were admitted for 
further testing to try to diagnose this mass. You had an 
ultrasound guided biopsy of your neck.  Analysis of the cells 
from the biopsy showed that these cells were likely cancer 
cells. You will have appointments with several doctors to help 
determine what type of treatment to perform. 
You will be called back by their office with the specific times. 


We made the following changes to your medications:

We STARTED diazepam (Valium). This medicine is similar to ativan 
(lorazepam). However, it lasts longer in your system. You should 
not take it at the same time as ativan. This can make you 
drowsy, so do not engage in activities that require alertness 
while taking.
