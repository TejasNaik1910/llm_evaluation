___ FLUID
PERITONEAL FLUID:
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma, suggestive of 
prostate primary.
Cell block preparation shows low tumor cellularity. On 
immunohistochemical studies, the tumor cells are positive for 
___ and B72.3 and focally positive for prostate specific 
antigen and possibly focally and weakly positive for prostatic 
acid phosphatase.

___ ABD LIMIT, SINGLE OR
1.  Bilateral obstructing renal stones with moderate right and 
mild left hydroureteronephrosis, slightly progressed since 
___.
2.  Partially imaged bilateral ureteral stents.
3.  Moderate volume ascites, progressed from the prior exam.

this
nondedicated exam, also seen on the recent outside hospital 
ultrasound but appear increased in number from the CT on 
___.

___ DIAG/THERA

therapeutic
paracentesis.  Fluid samples were submitted to the laboratory 
for analysis.
2. 3.5 L of fluid were removed.

___ ABDOMEN
The bilateral double-J nephroureteral stents are in unchanged 
position.

___ NEPHROSTO
Successful placement of 8 ___ nephrostomy tube on the left 
and partial embolization of the old percutaneous nephrostomy 
tract.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ advanced prostate cancer, metastatic to liver biopsy 
confirmed, heavy peritoneal involvement w/ peritoneal 
carcinamatosis, who is presenting for management of his leaking 
left surgical wound. 

#L HYDRONEPHROSIS, HYDROURETER:
#LEAKING PCN INCISION SITE: PCN tube removed on ___. Has
been leaking urine since that time. No e/o infection around the 
incision site. Fluid leaking from back was sampled, Cr 
consistent with urine. Previous PCN tract embolized, new PCN 
tube placed in L kidney on ___ by ___. PCN draining, no 
leakage. Continued to have significant pain in left flank around 
the area of PCN. Likely related to progression of disease +/- 
kidney stones - per Dr ___, pain is a new issue for the 
patient. Oxycontin was started on ___ with tremendous effect; 
pt with minimal pain following initiation of oxycontin; not 
requiring any PRN medications. Oxycontin may be able to be 
down-titrated as an outpatient. Will discharge with 5mg 
oxycodone for PRN.

___: Likely due to malignant obstruction vs pre-renal given
ascites and leakage of urine, in addition to long-standing poor 
PO intake. No intervention needed upon stents, per Urology. PCN 
placed, as above. Cr slightly uptrending prior to discharge, 
will get outpatient labs for ___ to monitor Cr. Pt declined 
an appetite stimulant.

#MALIGNANT ASCITES:
#NAUSEA/VOMITING: both of these issues new over past ___ weeks.
Paracentesis on ___ with 3.5L removed, fluid studies
consistent with ascites, no e/o infection. Cytology of fluid

prochlorperazine 10 mg PO Q6H:PRN nausea, ondansetron 4 mg IV 
Q8H:PRN nausea.

7.2. Stable today. No obvious signs of blood loss (denies 
hematuria) and
hemodynamically stable. Is not anticoagulated. Was noted to have
guaiac positive stool. Suspect this is due to inflammation given
advanced prostate cancer. Retic count 2.2, iron studies 
consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation. Received 1U 
pRBCs on ___ for H/H 7.___.8 prior to chemotherapy with 
appropriate response.

#DVT: recently LLE DVT but was told not an anticoagulation 
candidate due to GIB. Continued aspirin.

#ADVANCED PROSTATE CANCER: known to have liver mets and 
carcinomatosis. Per Dr ___ condition is terminal and 
prognosis is quite poor. Considering cabazitaxel as an 
outpatient, but this is not possible until PCN tract is
addressed and resolved. Now that tract is embolized, pt can 
start cabazitaxel.
Received dose of cabazitaxel ___. Will stop at ___ clinic 
upon discharge to have Neulasta on body placed (___).

#HTN: BP elevated for first several days of admission; holding 
home lisinopril 20mg daily in the setting of ___. Started 5mg 
amlodipine on ___ with improved BP control. Discharged off 
lisinopril, now with 5mg amlodipine daily.

#THROMBOCYTOSIS: downtrending since admission. Likely in the

oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Can be down-titrated in the 
outpatient setting (with Dr ___ as tolerated.
#HYPERTENSION: lisinopril discontinued in the setting of ___. 
Started on amlodipine 5mg for hypertension while admitted. Will 
discharge OFF lisinopril, ON amlodipine 5mg daily.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

You were admitted to ___ from 
___ to ___ for leaking from your old nephrostomy site.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You had a paracentesis (fluid drained from your belly), in 
which 3.5L of fluid was removed. The fluid was analyzed, and 
found to be consistent with malignant ascites, or fluid backed 
up from your liver as the result of cancer in your liver.
- The hole in your back that was draining urine was embolized 
(plugged) by our interventional radiology team. They also placed 
a new drain into your left kidney, which is now draining the 
urine from that kidney without issue.
- You were started on a long-acting pain medication, called 
oxycontin, for the pain in your back and belly. If this pain is 
being caused by kidney stones (which we see evidence of on 
imaging we did while you were here), we hope that the pain will 
improved and the amount of pain medication you require will be 
less.
- You received a dose of chemotherapy, cabazitaxel, on ___.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- You should return to the hospital on ___ to have your blood 
work done to check your kidney function.
- You will go to the ___ clinic to have your Neulasta patch 
placed.
- You will continue to take oxycontin 30mg twice a day and have 
oxycodone 5mg available as needed for breakthrough pain. You 
should follow-up with Dr ___ on ___ in his office, at 
which point you can discuss if you need more/less pain 
medication at that time.
- The nephrostomy tube will stay in place in your left kidney. 
You will eventually need it replaced by interventional radiology 
in ___ of this year.

If you have any further questions regarding your care here, 
please do not hesitate to contact us (11 ___ front desk 
___. We wish you the very best for your health going 
forward.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Oncology Team
