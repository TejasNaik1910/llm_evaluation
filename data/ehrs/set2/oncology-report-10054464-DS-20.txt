Admission Date:  ___              Discharge Date:   ___
 
Date of Birth:  ___             Sex:   M
 
Service: MEDICINE
 
Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ yo M with poorly differentiated squamous lung cancer on 
carboplatin/taxol ___ s/p thoracentesis with 500cc fluid 
removed now getting XRT to L lung. Had carboplatin/taxotere on 
___. Now with subjective SOB. Not requiring any 
more oxygen than he was using at home.  
.  
In the ED, initial vitals were T98.8, HR86, BP109/61, RR20, 
O299%. CXR was unchanged (known lung cancer and small pleural 
effusion). An EKG had changes consistent with ischemia (ST 
decreased in V2-V6), but thought to be demand ischemia. The ED 
faxed the EKG to cardiology who felt that even if this was 
ischemia no intervention could safely be done. Received 1L NS 
and ASA.  
.  
Oncologic History: Initial presentation prior to tissue 
diagnosis of core needle biopsy of back lesion on ___ showed 
poorly differentited squamous lung cancer in setting of LLL 
necrotic lung mass. Had 6 weeks of jaw pain and 6 months history 
of back mass initially thought to be sebaceous cyst. Started to 
develop constitutional symptoms of night sweats and weight loss 
complicated by jaw pain since mid ___. Pathology specifically 
showed: In a few areas, the tumor has vaguely squamoid features. 
However there is no definitive evidence of squamous or glandular 
differentiation. The tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 
AE1/AE3 and cytokeratin 7 and are negative for cytokeratin 20, 
TTF-1, HMB-45, MART1 and S100 protein. This immunophenotype 
confirms the epithelial nature of this tumor (i.e., carcinoma) 
and excludes malignant melanoma. Given the histologic appearance 
and immunophenotype, this could represent metastatic carcinoma 
of lung origin.

IMAGING:
CXR: Persistent left lower lung opacity, compatible with known 
tumor, post- obstructive consolidation, and pleural effusion. 
Small right 
pleural effusion. Improved left upper lung aeration.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: H/O recent NSTEMI, now with EKG changes but without 
significantly elevated troponins. Discussed with cards who felt 
that given all other comorbities, even if this was ischemia, no 
intervention could safely be performed.

to progression of disease.

3. UTI: Positive UA with elevated WBC. Treated with Cipro. 
Discharged on remainder of ___. Anemia: Normocytic, stable, likely of chronic disease in 
setting of malignancy. No further treatment at this time. 
 
5. Oncologic: Poorly differentiated metastatic squamous lung 
cancer with metastases to the adrenals, brain and soft tissue

Discharge Instructions:
Thank you for giving us the privilege of caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted to the

unit of blood because you were anemic.

We have started you on an antibiotic for your urinary tract 
infection. Please take this antibiotic as prescribed. 

We have not changed any of your previous medications. Please 
continue to take all of your regular medications as before upon 
leaving the hospital.
