History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is a ___ male w/PMHx including hepatitis B (on
tenofovir) complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma, and a 6mm
solid right lower lobe nodule lung, s/p right hepatic lobectomy
(at which time it was found the tumor infiltrated the
diaphragmatic muscle, but did not extend to the inked margin of
the diaphragm), who was admitted ___ with right-sided
pleural effusion and negative cytology.  Now presenting with
subjective fevers, shortness of breath, and tachycardia.

The patient started to have subjective fevers ~1mth ago, and 
then
1.5 weeks ago (around the time of his ___ admission), started
to have low-grade temperatures, for which he began to take
standing acetaminophen.  During the patient's ___
admission to the transplant surgery service, he had quite a few
temps in the ___, up to 100.6 at most (on ___.  During that
admission he was found to have a large right pleural effusion,
interventional pulmonology placed a chest tube, which drained 
800
cc of serosanguineous fluid.  Pleural fluid studies revealed a
lymphocytic exudative effusion, and CT imaging showed pleural
nodules, all concerning for metastases of HCC.  AFP was recent,
and had increased from 19 prior to his hepatic lobectomy to now
31.  However, cytology was negative.  Given concerns for
metastatic disease, a staging CT was performed, and in addition
to the pleural nodules, this showed a supra-hepatic IVC 
thrombus,
for which the patient was started on enoxaparin and transferred
to medicine.  He was then scheduled to follow-up in the
interventional pulmonology clinic for a thoracoscopy and biopsy
of the pleural nodules and with his oncologist today, ___.

When he was seen by his oncologist today (Dr. ___, through an interpreter, with his wife and daughter
present, he reported fever on a daily basis taking acetaminophen
every 6 hours, with temperatures as high as 100.6.  He also 
noted
sweats, reportedly profuse, no chills.  He noted chest 
discomfort
in the right side and mild and intermittent cough but no
shortness of breath.  He was found to be tachycardic, heart rate
122, with an O2 saturation of 94%, and respirations of 16,
temperature 99.3.  Labs showed a white count of 13.1 and chest
x-ray imaging showed "Substantial residual right pleural
effusion, probably loculated, containing small collections of
gas, right posterior and lower lateral hemithorax, extending 
into
the major fissure.  Persistent severe right basal atelectasis."

He was then referred to the ED: There he spiked a fever to 
101.8,
with associated tachycardia 130s, and was found to have 
tachypnea
___, satting 96% on 2 L, his heart rate improved to 107.  His
labs showed flu swab negative, blood culture was collected, ECG
showed sinus tachycardia with left anterior fascicular block.  
He
was given acetaminophen, piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin. 

He was also seen by interventional pulmonary who recommended ___
consultation for CT-guided chest tube placement.  OMED declined
admission, deferring to Medicine.

Seen on the floor: through an interpreter on speaker phone we
discussed his situation.  He felt ok, noted a bit of bilateral
chest discomfort, stable from prior, but denied shortness of
breath or cough.  He understood the plan to remove fluid from 
the
chest tomorrow, and to have him be NPO, get IVF, IV antibiotics,
and lab studies on the fluid.  He asked me to speak with his
daughter-in-law or son who would then distill the details of his
care and interpret them for him.  I then spoke with ___, 
his
dtr-in-law and reviewed the above history and the plan of care.

ROS: [x] As per above HPI, otherwise reviewed and negative in

CXR ___
Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently 
___. Substantial residual right pleural 
effusion, probably loculated, containing small collections of 
gas, right posterior and lower lateral hemithorax, extending 
into the major fissure.  Persistent severe right basal 
atelectasis. 
Left lung clear.  Heart size normal. 

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ___
Again redemonstrated is a complex right small to moderate 
pleural effusion 
with multiple locules of gas. The overall volume of the pleural 
effusion has decreased in comparison to the prior examination, 
however, hyperattenuating areas appear to be slightly larger.  
Given the 8 day interval between the two CT examinations and the 
increase in size it is favored that these represent areas of 
hemothorax and blood clot (also given reported prior negative 
cytology results).  PET/CT could be of value after acute 
symptoms have resolved to evaluate for the degree of possible 
metastatic disease. Stable small pulmonary nodules, suspicious 
for metastatic disease. 

CT INTERVENTIONAL PROCE ___
Successful CT-guided placement of ___ pigtail catheter into 
the 
collection. Samples was sent for microbiology evaluation. 

CT CHEST - ___
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight increase in size of moderate right loculated pleural 
effusion
containing high-density material suggestive of blood products, 
and foci of
air.
2. Additional small hydropneumothorax along the right upper lobe 
is new from
prior CT.  Status post chest tube removal.
3. Small simple left pleural effusion.
4. Unchanged 6 mm right upper lobe nodule and 9 mm left upper 
lobe nodule,
indeterminate.
5. New visualization of small sub segmental pulmonary embolism 
of the right
upper lobe.

PATHOLOGY: 
==========
Pleural Fluid: 
DIAGNOSIS:
PLEURAL FLUID, RIGHT:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Many red blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and rare 
mesothelial cells. 

Pleura Biopsy/Excision: 
PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:
1. Exudate, right hemothorax, decortication:
- METASTATIC HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, present in a background 
of fibrin and organizing blood clot.
2. Nodule, right pleura, excision:
- METASTATIC HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, present in a background 
of fibrin and organizing blood clot.
3. Right pleura, decortication:
- Pleural tissue with METASTATIC HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, 
present in a background of fibrin and organizing blood clot.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
===================
___ h/o HepB on tenofovir, ___ s/p recent R hepatic lobectomy 
with cholecystectomy and partial excision and repair of right 
hemidiaphragm, with recent readmission for R sided exudative 
pleural effusion of unclear etiology, also found to have 
pulmonary nodules and a supra-hepatic IVC thrombus prompting 
initiation of lovenox, readmitted ___ with sepsis and 
empyema, requiring operative management with course complicated 
by pulmonary abscess, hemoptysis and ___.

# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure 
# Sepsis
# Empyema 
# RLL abscess
Patient with recent admission for pleural effusion of unclear 
etiology, status post drainage readmitted with fevers and 
dyspnea, imaging showing complex effusion, with fluid studies 
consistent with empyema. Patient started on broad spectrum 
antibiotics, had pleural drain placed by ___ with minimal 
sanguinous drainage, followed by chest tube placed by IP also 
with minimal sanguinous drainage. During this time patient had 
minimal clinical improvement, remained with loculated effusion 
and ongoing fevers. Patient was seen by ID consult service and 
thoracic surgery consult service who recommended surgical 
management. Patient transferred to thoracic surgery service when 
he underwent RLL VATS/decortication/pulmonary nodule biopsy. His 
surgery was complicated by transient hypotension and blood loss 
for which he received albumin and blood products respectively; 
he was subsequently transferred to the medicine service. While 
on the medicine service, pleural tissue pathology resulted and 
was consistent with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Pleural 
fluid was without malignant cells. However, it was thought that 
the patient's pleural effusion was most likely malignant in 
nature. Placement of a PleurX was discussed with thoracic 
surgery given concern for recurrent pleural effusions, but 
deemed unnecessary, given that the decortication procedure 
performed during the patient's hospitalization was akin to a 
mechanical pleurodesis. The patient was maintained on vancomycin 
and zosyn for the majority of his hospitalization excepting a 2 
day interruption in antibiotics which was accompanied by 
recurrent leukoctysis. Vancomycin was discontinued on ___ 
after MRSA swab resulted negative. Patient was transitioned to 
augmentin (D1: ___, with plan for ___ week course in the 
setting of concern for RLL parenchymal abscess raised by 
Interventional Pulmonology after re-review of patient's CT chest 
and bronchoscopy. Patient was discharged on augmentin with plan 
for follow up with Interventional Pulmonology as outpatient for 
monitoring of possible abscess.

#Hemoptysis
#Epistaxis
#Bleeding around chest tube
Hospital course was complicated by low volume hemoptysis in the 
setting of recent heparin administration which persisted for 
several days. Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended 
Interventional Pulmonology involvement. Interventional 
pulmonology recommended CT chest, which did not reveal etiology. 
IP also recommended bronchoscopy which indicated that the RLL 
was the source of bleed. Per IP, no acute intervention was 
warranted. On re-review of chest CT, IP was concerned for 
intraparenchymal abscess. In line with IP recommendations, we 
proceeded with antibiotic treatment as above, with patient 
discharged on ___ week course of augmentin with planned follow 
up with IP. Heparin gtt was reinitiated after bronchoscopy and 
tolerated well with patient transitioned to lovenox prior to 
discharge. 

___
Patient with baseline Cr ~0.7, increased to max 1.4 in the 
setting of blood loss, poor PO intake, nephrotoxic antibiotic 
regimen. Blood products and fluids were given as needed with 
mild improvement in creatinine. Urine lytes obtained near the 
end of ___ hospital course were consistent with intrarenal 
etiology, with improvement in creatinine after removing 
vancomycin and zosyn from patient's medication regimen. Patient 
was discharged with creatinine of 1.0 with plan for outpatient 
BMP.

#TB rule out
ID with concern that pulmonary nodules seen on patient's CT 
chest could represent TB. As such patient underwent TB rule out. 
Respiratory precautions were put in place. Acid fast 
smear/culture from induced sputum was negative x3 and 
respiratory precautions were lifted. Pulmonary nodules were 
biopsied and found to be consistent with metastatic 
hepatocellular carcinoma.

# Chronic IVC thrombus
Diagnosed during previous admission in ___, concerning for 
possible tumor thrombus. Was treated with lovenox, bridged with 
IV heparin periprocedurally. Reinitiated heparin gtt on ___ in 
s/o stable CBC which was held intermittently with concern for 
new onset hemoptysis. After bronchoscopy performed as above, 
heparin was reinitiated at weigh- based protocol. Patient was 
transitioned to lovenox without adverse event. 

# Pulmonary nodules 
# Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
Patient has known pleural nodules suspicious for metatatic HCC 
disease. Now pathology confirmed. See above.  

#Nutrition
Patient has minimal appetite in the setting of metastatic 
disease. No associated nausea/vomiting. His meals supplements 
were supplemented with Glucerna shakes. Patient was initiated on 
mirtazapine to assist with appetite. 

# Chronic Hepatitis B
Continued home tenofovir

# Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
Continued prn oxycodone

# Diabetes type 2
Continued insulin sliding scale 

# BPH
Continued Finasteride, Tamsulosin 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[] Patient with hospital course complicated by ___ thought to be 
of mixed etiology (prerenal/intrarenal). Improved creatinine on 
discharge but not back to baseline of 0.7. Please obtain BMP as 
outpatient to monitor and ensure continued improvement.
[] Patient with likely intraparenchymal abscess. Plan for 
outpatient follow up with IP, Dr. ___. Patient should have CT 
scan within ___ weeks for monitoring of abscess (to be scheduled 
by IP). If no response to prolonged antibiotic course, will 
likely need surgical intervention.
[] Patient should continue with 6 week course of Augmentin (Day 
1: ___ - ___
[] Patient with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Will need 
close follow up with outpatient oncologist for treatment 
planning.
[] Patient with decreased appetite and poor PO intake throughout 
hospitalization. Primary oncologist should monitor nutrition as 
outpatient.
[] Patient has had elevated fasting blood glucose this 
hospitalization but has required <1u Novolog per day. Please 
evaluate for outpatient management of likely DM with oral 
medications.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___.

Why did you come to the hospital?
- You came to the hospital because you had an infection in your 
lungs.

What did you receive in the hospital?
- In the hospital, our thoracic surgeons performed a procedure 
to allow your lungs to better expand and minimize the risk of 
fluid accumulation in the lungs.
- You also received antibiotics to treat a pulmonary abscess (an 
area of infection). You were discharged on these antibiotics as 
this type of infection requires a long course of treatment.
- You were started on a medication to increase your appetite as 
our nutritionists feel you would greatly benefit from more food 
intake. 
- You were reinitiated on your anticoagulation therapy (blood 
thinners) which you are on for your increased risk of blood 
clots. You currently have blood clots in one of your large blood 
vessels and in your lungs. The anticoagulation therapy should 
stabalize these clots.

What should you do once you leave the hospital?
- Make sure to continue to take your medications as prescribed 
and follow up with your outpatient providers.
- If you develop any fevers, lethargy, shortness of breath, 
please go to the emergency room immediately

We wish you all the best!
- Your ___ Care Team
