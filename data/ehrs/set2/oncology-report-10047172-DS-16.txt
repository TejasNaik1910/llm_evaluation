Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Mr. ___ was diagnosed pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to
the liver in ___ when he was admitted for painless
jaundice. CT showed 3.3cm pancreatic head mass and MRI
showed a 1.8cm left kidney lesion concerning for RCC as well as 
2
sub-cm liver masses. FNA of pancreas showed 'suspicious' cells.
His pancreatic mass was deemed unresectable due to abutting the
SMV and portal vein. He was treated with three cycles of
FOLFIRINOX ___ which was halted due to rising CA 
___
and increased size of liver metastases. In ___,  CA
___ elevated to 23K and considered potentially related to left
finger infection in setting of diabetes. Imaging shows increased
size of liver metastases. In ___ he started
gemcitabine/Abraxane. Imaging ___ showing slight decrease 
in
the size of the liver metastases with stable disease at the
pancreas. Course complicated by right thigh muscle infarct
presumed ___ diabetes in ___. Primary chemotherapy side
effect has been neuropathy on the bottoms of b/l feet without
impairment of ADLs. Has required multiple dose and schedule
adjustments in order to maximize quality of life, minimize 
marrow
toxicity and maintain control over tumor (primarily assessed by
tumor marker). Imaging has showed mixed response in early ___:
given discordance with ___, unclear if true progression vs
variations due to reduced chemotherapy exposure at various time
points for various toxicity and scheduling reasons. In setting 
of
increasing side effects and  mixed response by imaging/markers,
changed to CapOx on ___ scans show a mixed response to treatment, regimen
changed to modified FOLFIRINOX 
-___: Began modified FOLFIRINOX with dose reduction ___
IVP and Leucovorin held from regimen) (Per OMR, patient
previously given this regimine at ___ for 3 cycles ___ ago)
-___: CT scan showed progression of disease with an interval
increase in size of the innumerable  hepatic masses, increased
abnormal soft tissue in the retroperitoneum, and 
increasing ascites.
-___: Patient started on erlotinib with plan for C1D1 of
gemcitabine on ___.
-Admitted to ___ on ___ for hyperbilirubinemia, fevers, 
n/v,
and acute urinary retention.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with pancreatic ca s/p recent ERCP w 
CBD stent placement, DM type 2, recent biliary sepsis s/p 
stent/completed abx course (last dose zosyn ___ who presented 
with intermittent melena. Repeat ERCP found retained food in 
stomach and duodenal bulb (?due to mass compressing on 
duodenum), could not see source of bleeding. Responded well to 
1u PRBC for anemia and GI bleeding appears to have stopped on 
his own. He has generally had poor po intake over several weeks 
in the setting of a known duodenal obstruction relating to his 
cancer and he was started on TPN (___) via ___. 

Hospital course complicated by hyperglycemia (controlled by the 
addition of insulin to the TPN) and thrombocytopenia (most 
likely relating to his known liver involvement and splenomegaly 
but heparin-dependent antibody was sent), improving upon 
discharge. On day of discharge plts >100 tomorrow and he 
received a dose of gemcitabine/erlotinib (per Dr. ___. 
Tolerating cycled TPN well, decreased insulin in TPN prior to 
discharge due to hypoglycemia overnight during cycle, patient 
awoke with symptoms. 

Rest of hospital course/plan as outlined below by issue: 

# Gastric/Duodenal outlet obstruction with protein calorie 
malnutrition: Initially with nausea/vomiting, poor PO intake 
which improved overall however not to the point to sustain his 
nutrition on a full liquid diet alone. He declined NJ tube 
placement. The issue of a J tube placement was raised however he 
was determined to be too high risk (given worsening ascites and 
liver mets). Discussed with surgery, who felt that presence of 
ascites and liver mets put him at very high risk for ascetic 
superinfection and poor wound healing. Given patient's aversion 
to NJT, discussed nutritional options again with ERCP team 
including revisiting attempting duodenal stent but not a 
candidate for a duodenal stent (given high likelihood of 
migration). The decision was made with Mr. ___ and his wife 
to pursue initiation of TPN. 
- TPN started ___ per nutrition recs, tolerating cycled TPN upon 
discharge. 

# Anasarca due to protein calorie malnutrition: Felt some 
improvement with lasix 20mg PO, so started on daily dosing x 7 
days with counseling for daily weights and expected inadequate 
diuresis until protein levels improved. 
- lasix 20 mg PO daily
- repeat lytes in follow up

# Melena, upper GI bleed, Acute blood loss anemia on anemia of 
chronic inflammation: CBC stable after 1u PRBC ___. Suspect 
residual blood in current stools, but most likely this was tumor 
bleeding.

# Metastatic pancreatic cancer: Diagnosed ___ stage 4, 
progressed on modified FOLFIRINOX, C1 Gemzar ___ received 
erlotinib. SW consult placed but patient declined. Inpatient 
chemo was delayed due to thrombocytopenia, which improved prior 
to discharge, and he received dose of gemcitabine/erlotinib on 
day of discharge due to improvement in platelets. 
- continued home Ritalin, ativan, Creon with liquids as 
tolerated

# Thrombocytopenia: feel most likely due to liver disease with 
multiple mets (splenomegaly noted on MRI from ___) however 
progressive nature concerning for HIT, HIT-antibody was sent. 
Note that he had not been receiving sc heparin while inpatient 
due to concern for GI bleeding but had been receiving heparin 
flushes for his port. Thombocytopenia improved prior to 
discharge. 
- changed heparin flushes to citrate
- follow up CBC as outpatient

# HTN: continued home amlodipine, lisinopril

# Acute Kidney Injury: Improved with IVF, likely prerenal. 

# Hyponatremia: Mild, likely hypovolemic and improved with IVF 
overnight. History of SIADH, known lingular mass unlikely 
playing a role during this admission. 

# Recent Klebsiella bacteremia: completed treatment course with 
Zosyn on ___, no evidence of infection throughout this 
admission. 

# DMII: HISS, hyperglycemic after PO intake improved. Restarted 
lantus 10U qAM (home dose previously 15U qAM) + ISS + insulin 
contained in his TPN which was titrated.

# Abnormal LFTs: likely due to numerous liver mets, relatively 
stable

# GOC: Wife and patient are very well-educated about his 
condition, want every aggressive treatment. Full code

# Transitional Issues: 
-continue full liquids (although per ERCP, should not advance 
any further)
-f/u with Dr. ___ ongoing chemotherapy 
-follow up with Dr. ___ with outpatient dietician ___ 
___ for ongoing management of TPN. You need outpatient 
labs drawn to follow your TPN 
-heparin dependent antibodies will need to be followed up by Dr. 
___ with her over the phone, aware of test sent)
# ACCESS on discharge: PORT, PICC placed ___

> 30 minutes spent on discharge day planning, counseling, and 
coordination care. Discussed with patient and primary oncologist 
close follow up. Medically stable for discharge home with 
services.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted for bleeding from the GI tract relating to 
your underlying pancreatic cancer. You had an ERCP which showed 
retained food in your stomach but no source of bleeding. You had 
poor nutrition relating to obstruction by the cancer on your 
duodenum so a PICC line was placed and you were started on total 
parenteral nutrition (TPN) which was adjusted over the weekend. 
Please make sure to have some juice when TPN finishes in the 
morning. 

Your home long acting lantus insulin dose was decreased to 
10units. 

You should not advance your diet beyond liquids due to the risk 
of obstruction in your intestine.  

Your platelets were low which is likely due to tumor involvement 
in your liver, but they were improving prior to discharge, and 
you were able to get your chemotherapy on ___.

Follow up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient for ongoing 
chemotherapy. You should follow up with Dr. ___ with 
outpatient dietician ___ for ongoing management of 
your TPN. You need outpatient labs drawn to follow your TPN 
which will be followed up by this provider. 

Please make sure you weigh yourself daily, and call your doctor 
if your weight increases by more than ___ in 24 hours. Please 
take Lasix daily to help with your swelling for the next week. 
If you start to feel dizzy or dehydrated, DO NOT take your Lasix 
and call your doctor right away. 

We wish you all the best.
