IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. 

___ 10:___HEST W/CONTRAST 
IMPRESSION:  
1.  New ground-glass opacities with septal thickening and 
dependent small pleural effusions, most suggestive of 
hydrostatic edema.  Differential agnosis includes atypical 
infection and less likely leukemic nfiltration. 
2. Pre-existing lung nodules are difficult to compare to the 
prior CT due to technical limitations of today's exam.  Consider 
a ___ month followup CT to allow more precise comparison of a 
potentially growing left upper lobe nodule in order to exclude 
the possibility of a slowly growing lesion within the lung 
adenocarcinoma spectrum. 

___ 10:___BD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No intra-abdominal infection or hemorrhage is identified. 
2. Splenomegaly (similar to ___ CT)

PATHOLOGY:
==========
___ FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT 
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that a major subset of the 
cells isolated from this peripheral blood are in the CD45 
dim/low side scatter Â“blast" region. They express CD38, immature 
antigens CD34, ___, nTdT (dim subset ~39%), myeloid 
associated antigens cytoplasmic MPO, CD117 and CD33. They 
co-express CD56. 
They lack B-cell associated antigens (CD19, cCD22, cCD79a), T 
cells (cCD3) associated antigens and are negative for CD13, 
CD14, CD64, CD11b. 
Blast cells comprise 88% of total analyzed events. 
INTERPRETATION
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute 
myeloid leukemia. 
Correlation with clinical, morphologic (see separate pathology 
report ___ cytogenetic findings is recommended. 

___ HEMATOPATHOLOGY REPORT - Final
DIAGNOSIS:
RELAPSED ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA, SEE NOTE.
NOTE: By flow cytometry, blasts comprise >90% of total analyzed 
events and have a myeloid immunophenotype expressing CD38, CD34, 
HLADR, nTdT (subset), CD117, CD33, cyMPO, along with CD56. 
Please correlate with cytogenetics (___-1550) findings. 
Findings discussed at interdepartmental ___ conference on 
___.
ASPIRATE SMEAR:
The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and consists of 
multiple cellular spicules. The cellularity is almost entirely 
comprised of blasts with cytomorphologic features similar to 
those described above. Residual hematopoiesis is extremely 
scant.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with a history of stage IIA breast 
cancer ___- s/p left mastectomy and currently on 
tamoxifen, also with a history of intermediate risk AML s/p 
reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplant ___, MRD 
sister) currently in remission who presented with myalgias, 
night sweats, fatigue and leukocytosis concerning for acute 
leukemia.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Relapsed acute leukemia: BM Bx ___ consistent with relapse. 
Treated w/ MEC (D1 = ___, no blasts on D23 sustained. 
Sluggish count recovery. Given low counts, repeat BM deferred to 
outpatient setting (f/u apt scheduled ___. 
# Abx: After completing tx for febrile neutropenia (cefepime, 
doxy), maintained on PPX with ciprofloxacin, acyclovir, 
voriconazole.

# Dizziness/ Orthostatic symptoms: Differential includes 
autonomic neuropathy ___ chemo vs medication side effect 
(reported on voriconazole PI but incidence not included). 
Endocrine and cardiac sources less likely based on normal ___ 
stim (___), normal TSH (___), and normal LVEF (___). The 
role of anemia has also been considered, however, the Hgb has 
been stable for several days. Switched fludrocort -> midodrine 
___. Midodrine titrated with good effect. Discharged on 
midodrine 7.5mg QAM and at noon, and 10mg QPM given symtoms 
occur o/n or in early AM

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Stage IIA breast cancer s/p mastectomy: Continued tamoxifen 
daily

# Atypical chest pain: Had point tenderness above mastectomy 
scar and in R axilla, at different points during 
hospitalization. Most likely MSK or neuropathic and resolved 
prior to discharge. However, given h/o breast CA, there was 
concern for recurrent breast cancer. If symptoms worsen, would 
obtain chest imaging (CT v. MRI) to evaluate for masses.

RESOLVED ISSUES:
================
# Pulmonary Edema/Borderline O2 sats: Acute pulmonary edema in 
setting of fluids with medications and as treatment for acute 
leukemia ___, improved O2 sats ___ and ___ after diuresis. 
Repeat TTE showed normal EF. Responded to Lasix 20mg IV PRN

# Tick exposure: tick bite ___ wks prior to presentation. 
Treated w/ doxycycline x2 weeks. Serologies returned negative.

# Pain: Severe multifocal pain on admission, worst site low back 
spasms; significantly improved. Improvement coincident with 
chemotherapy suggests cancer-related pain most likely; 
differential includes infection and electrolyte shifts. Negative 
lyme serologies argue against infection. Not requiring pain 
management today.

# Loose stools: Loose stools for several days without abdominal 
pain or tenderness.  Differential is medication side effect, 
infection or GVHD. Given benign abdomen and no history of 
chronic GHVD, most likely medication effect. C diff negative 
___ and ___. Resolved w/ discontinuation of cefepime___.

TRANSITIONAL:
=============
- ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION: If persistent orthostatic sx, refer 
to ___ clinic
- CHEST PAIN: Had intermittent chest pain near mastectomy site. 
If progresses while patient immunosuppressed, please consider 
the need for imaging/ recurrence
