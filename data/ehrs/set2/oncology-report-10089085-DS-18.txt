Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with recently diagnosed Stage 3 Squamous Cell 
Lung Cancer who was admitted for interventional pulmonology 
procedure on ___ with bronschoscopy and removal of RMS stent 
and replacement of tracheostomy with tracheal button. Patient 
was consequently admitted to medicine for postprocedural 
observation, respiratory therapy, and pain control. 
Hospitalization course was notable for aflutter that resolved 
with IV Metoprolol pushes. Patient was saturating well post 
procedure. Her hospital course is summarized by problems below: 

#Lung Cancer: Patient with newly diagnosed lung cancer s/p IP 
bronchoscopy on ___ with removal of RMS stent and removal of 
tracheostomy and replacement with tracheal button. Patient was 
saturating well on tracheal mask after the procedure. Patient 
was treated with Mucinex ___ mg ER po BID, 3% NS nebulizer 
treatment BID in addition to albuterol and ipratroprium 
nebulizers. Tracheal button was left open to tracheal mask at 
nights. Patient complained of dysphagia, likely secondary to 
this procedure and inflammation from recent radiation therapy 
and patient received viscous lidocaine. Pain was controlled with 
3.5 po oxycodone q 3 prn pain. Bronchial washings obtained 
during the procedure were pending at time of discharge and will 
need to be followed up. Patient will be contacted by 
interventional pulmonology for appointment in  ___ weeks. 
Tracheal button was suctioned ___ times a day and more 
frequently as needed.

#Atrial Flutter: Hospital course was notable for atrial flutter, 
likely secondary to procedural stress. Heart rate responded 
appropriately to metoprolol pushes. Patient was monitored on 
telemetry overnight and returned to normal sinus rhythm. She was 
continued on home dose of metoprolol, cardizem, and ASA was 
restarted on hospital day one.

#URI- Patient recently felt ill one week prior to admission with 
increased cough and thick sputum production. Patient was started 
on Augmentin prior to admission. She was continued on augmentin 
for a total of 10 additional days with end date ___. 
Bronchial washings were pending at time of discharge. 

#Hypotension: Patient had SBP in the ___ on post procedure day 
2. Patient was nonorthostatic but was complaining of some 
lightheadedness with standing. Likely her blood pressure 
medications are contributing to lightheadedness. Patient was 
given fluid hydration with improvement in SBP's. Should 
rediscuss need to downtitrate BP medication as outpatient 
pending adequate rate control of atrial flutter.

Chronic Issues:
# COPD- Patient was continued on nebulizers while in house.

#  HLD: Patient was continued on home dose of simvastatin 10
 
#  HTN:Continued cardizem and metoprolol. 

#Depression: Continued Buproprion
 
#Anxiety: Continued ativan prn anxiety. 

Transitional Issues:
-Continued care of pulmonary cancer
-Respiratory therapy at Rehab with continued nebulizers.  
-Monitoring for afib/flutter in future with discussion for 
future need for anticoagulation.
-Patient had some lightheadedness with standing during 
admission. Blood pressure medications may need to be titrated 
down as heart rhythm/rate tolerates.
