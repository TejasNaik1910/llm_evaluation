Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 
You were admitted to the hospital because of a brain mass that 
was then resected. As you had major surgery, there are some 
safety precautions we want you to follow when you leave the 
hospital.  They are as follows:

Have a friend/family member check your incision daily for 
signs of infection.
Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, 
or excessive bending.

You must wait until after your sutures are removed to wash 
your hair. You may shower before this time using a shower cap to 
cover your head.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain 
medicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking 
an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) & 
Senna while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any 
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and 
Ibuprofen etc.  
You were prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure 
medicine, please take it as prescribed and follow up with 
laboratory blood drawing in one week.  This can be drawn at your 
PCPs office, but please have the results faxed to ___.
You are being sent home on steroid medication, so make sure 
you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, 
Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach 
irritation.  Make sure to take your steroid medication with 
meals, or a glass of milk. 
Clearance to drive and return to work will be addressed at 
your post-operative office visit.
Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while 
at home.
CALL YOUR SURGEON IMMEDIATELY IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE 
FOLLOWING

New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status. 
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not 
relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, 
increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
Fever greater than or equal to 101.5° F.
