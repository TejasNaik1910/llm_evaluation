History of Present Illness:
This is an ___ year old man with past medical history significant 
for CAD s/p bare metal stents x2 in ___, systolic dysfunction 
(EF 35%), chronic atrial fibrillation on warfarin, VF arrest 
status pos pacemaker and ICD placement, and rectal cancer s/p 
resection who presented with melena.  Ten days prior to 
presentation, he began to notice that the stools in his ostomy 
bag were dark. The color was not frankly black, but darker than 
usual. He denied nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, pain after 
meals, epigastric pain, abdominal pain, constipation, or 
diarrhea.  He did aknowledge chronic dysphagia that had been 
persistent for many years.  He also denied syncope, 
lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and chest pain.  On the 
day of admission, he presented to his PCP's office with the 
complaint of black stools, and those stools were found to be 
grossly guaiac positive. Hence, he was admitted for further 
work-up.  Of note, the patient had a colonoscopy approximately 
eight days prior to presentation for follow-up of his colon 
cancer.  This study was essentially normal.  
  
On the presentation to the ED the patient continued to deny 
complaints and was hemodynamically stable. He received 
pantoprazole 40 mg IV and had IV access established with two 
large bore IV's.  He was then admitted to the floor.   
  
<b><u>Review of Systems:</b></U>
He claims a ___ weight loss over the last week, but denies 
watery stools or increased urine output.  He has mild dyspnea on 
exertion that has increased over the last month. He denies chest 
pain, SOB, diaphresis, night sweats, fevers, chills.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo man with chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CAD s/p 
stents on plavix and aspirin, and history of rectal cancer s/p 
resection and ostomy reconstruction, presents with anemia and 
dark stools.  
 
1) Anemia/GI bleed: On presentation the patient was anemic with 
melena, but he was hemodynamically stable and relatively 
asymptomatic.  Hematocrit on presentation was 26.1 so he was not 
immediately transfused, but he did have large bore IV's inserted 
and received fluid boluses.  He was also started on BID PPI 
therapy and his anticoagulants (aspirin, clopidogrel, and 
warfarin) were held.  His second hematocrit had dropped to 23.3, 
but as there was not a great deal of stool or blood in his 
ostomy bag this was presumed to be more consistent with dilution 
than continued brisk bleeding.  Still, at that time transfusion 
was offered, but the patient was quite reluctant and as he 
continued to be hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic 
transfusion was held.  As the day progressed hematocrit rose 
back to 25 and remained stable throughout the rest of his 
hospitalization.  Gastroenterology was consulted on the day 
after presentation and planned to take the patient for EGD after 
allowing the INR to fall for a day.  Unfortunately, the INR 
remained elevated, but at that point gastroenterology elected to 
proceed with EGD with a plan not to do any interventions unless 
their was overt, active bleeding.  On EGD the patient had 
gastritis and duodenitis but no ulcers or obvious other sources 
of bleeding.  ___, no intervention was performed and the patient 
was discharged on BID PPI and with a reduced anticoagulant 
regimen to follow up in GI clinic.  Stools at discharge were 
non-melenic.  Hematocrit was greater than 25.    

2) CAD s/p BMS ___: The patient has history of coronary artery 
disease and had bare metal stents placed in ___.  
Nevertheless, he never had chest pain or other signs of active 
ischemia.  His aspirin and clopidogrel were held on presentation 
due to concern for active bleeding.  At discharge he was 
restarted on warfarin and aspirin but as it was greater than one 
year out from his stent placement it was considered safe to hold 
clopidogrel at discharge in order to decrease the number of 
anticoagulants the patient was taking.  The patient's 
cardiologist, Dr ___, was made aware of this decision and 
thought it was reasonable.  

3)Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has an EF of 35% by 
previous echocardiograms but never showed signs of acute volume 
overload or evidenced dyspnea in the hospital.  Initially, his 
aspirin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, and diuretic were held in 
the context of potentially active bleeding and concern about 
hemodynamic stability.  These were all restarted prior to 
discharge.  

4)HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension but was never 
frankly hypertensive in the hospital.  His anti-hypertensives 
were initially held in the hospital and then restarted as 
described in the previous problem point.  

5)Chronic atrial fibrillation: The patient is on metoprolol for 
rate control and warfarin for stroke prevention.  His rate 
remained relatively well controlled even when metoprolol was 
being held. His warfarin was held on presentation but restarted 
after his procedure.  His INR never became subtherapeutic.  He 
will follow up with his PCP for further INR monitoring. 

As the patient was systemically anticoagulated no further DVT 
prophylaxis was given.  He was on BID PPI for GI bleed.  He 
tolerated a full diet prior to discharge.  He was full code.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you were bleeding into 
your gastrointestinal tract so that blood was showing up in your 
colostomy bag.  The GI specialists passed a camera into your 
stomach (endoscopy) and saw some irritation of the lining of 
your stomach called gastritis.  We will medically manage this by 
giving you the acid blocking medicine (proton pump inhibitor) 
and by decreasing the number of medications you are on that 
encourage bleeding.  You will follow up in the GI clinic as 
well.  As your blood counts were stable we are now discharging 
you to complete your recovery at home.  

Your medications have been changed.  Your CLOPIDOGREL (PLAVIX) 
has been stopped; this was discussed with your cardiologist who 
agreed;  as you are now far enough out from your stent placement 
that this medication is not necessary.  
You have also been started on the proton pump inhibitor for 
blocking stomach acid.  This medication is called PANTOPRAZOLE 
(PROTONIX).  Please continue to take all other medications as 
prescribed.  We recommend you avoid alcohol for the next few 
weeks as your stomach lining heals.  

Please keep all scheduled follow-up appointments as these are 
important to help manage your health.  You will also need to 
have your INR rechecked next week as you were off this 
medication in the hospital and your dose will need to be 
re-titrated.  

Please call your doctor or go to the Emergency Room if you have 
fever>101, chest pain, shortness of breath, further black or red 
material in your ostomy bag, intractable nausea/vomiting, 
lightheadedness, fainting, or other concerning changes to your 
health.

Regarding your heart failure, you should weigh yourself every 
morning and contact your doctor if your weight changes > 3 lbs 
over the course of 24 hours.  Please limit your salt intake to 2 
gms/day.
