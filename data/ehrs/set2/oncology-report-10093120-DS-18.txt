Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman without significant past 
medical history presenting with partial small bowel obstruction, 
pelvic masses, carcinomatosis, who was initially admitted to 
medicine for further workup and was transferred to gynecologic 
oncology service on hospital day #2 given concern for ovarian 
malignancy.

In regards to her partial small bowel obstruction, patient had a 
CT abdomen/pelvis which demonstrated a dilated small bowel with 
transition point in pelvis. Per radiology, the small bowel was 
likely entrapped and dilated by tumor. Patient did not endorse 
any nausea and continued to pass flatus. Acute care surgery was 
consulted and patient was made NPO with IV fluids, anti-emetics, 
and narcotics as needed. Patient tolerated sips on hospital day 
#2, Ensure clear/toast/crackers on hospital day #3, and a 
regular diet on hospital day #4.

In regards to the concern for ovarian malignancy, she had a CT 
which demonstrated a 12cm cystic and solid pelvic soft tissue 
mass, ascites, and peritoneal carcinomatosis. A CT chest 
revealed 0.9cm supradiaphragmatic lymph nodes, which could 
possibly represent metastases. ___ was Tumor markers revealed 
elevated CA-125 of 522 and CEA level of 0.6. She had a 
paracentesis performed in the emergency room for 2 liters of 
ascites, and cytology was sent for analysis. Interventional 
radiology was consulted, however her omental lesions were too 
small to biopsy.

On hospital day #6, patient underwent a TAH/BSO, appendectomy, 
omenectomy. Afterwards she was admitted to ___ for mild 
hypotension post-op requiring neo. She was treated with unasyn 
for purulent fluid from one ovary as well as imaging concerning 
for pneumonia, and her blood pressure improved. She had an NGT 
placed intra-operatively which was removed without issue on 
post-operative day 3.

Her post-operative course was complicated by an elevated INR, 
for which she received vitamin K with resolution. Her pain was 
initially managed with an epidural and was then transitioned to 
oral medications. Her diet was advanced slowly due to 
post-operative ileus. Her foley catheter was removed on 
post-operative day 3 and she voided spontaneously. By 
post-operative day 10 she was voiding, tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating independently with good pain control. She was 
then discharged home with ___ services to continue lovenox for 
prophylactic anticoagulation.
