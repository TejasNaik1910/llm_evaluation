History of Present Illness:
___ y.o. man with Crohn's disease s/p multiple bowel resections 
(no colon on recent enteroscopy but anatomy unclear) complicated 
by recurrent diarrhea and dehydration (unclear etiology, ? short 
gut), hx of DM, CKD (Cr 1.5-2), HL, gout who has been suffering 
repeated episodes of volume depletion due to high stoma output 
and was admitted to ___ with the same, transferred to 
___ for further evalauation of this and worsening renal 
failure.
.
Patient has an extensive GI history as documented in Dr. ___ 
___ ___. His Crohn's dz is reportedly controlled on 
anti-TNF. He has had over 20 admissions in the past year for the 
same presentation and has been getting IVF on QOD basis as an 
outpatient.  His increasing stool output has been a problem for 
over ___ years, and has worsened progressively worse over the past 
year. Most recent hospitalization at ___ w/ d/c at ___ was 
notable for an evaluation of infectious causes (neg. stool Cx 
for salmonella, shigella, campy, VRE, O/P x1, giardia), C.Diff 
was negative.  CT enterography on ___ revealed no 
abnormalities, small bowel followthrough ___ showed 2.5hr 
transit to ostomy, nl sm. bowel with porgressive ectasia 
distally.  No colon was identified during this study.  Given 
negative prior w/up (limited as pt. could not receive contrast) 
and persistent diarrhea, he underwent a secretory diarrhea w/up 
neuroendocrine markers were sent showing an elevated 
chromographin assay (322 nl < 255), and nl Serotonin, gastrin,

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o. man with Crohn's disease s/p multiple bowel resections 
(no colon on recent enteroscopy but anatomy unclear) complicated 
by recurrent diarrhea and dehydration (unclear etiology, ? short 
gut), hx of DM, CKD (Cr 1.5-2), HL, gout who has been suffering 
repeated episodes of volume depletion due to high stoma output 
and was admitted to ___ with the same, transferred to 
___ for further evalauation of the above and worsening renal 
failure.
.  
ACTIVE ISSUES
# Increased ostomy output: This has been an ongoing problem for 
the patient over the past year complicated by severe 
malnutrition in the past few months. Etiology under 
investigation with extensive w/up as above. The most likely 
cause of his high ostomy output per GI is dietary noncompliance 
via drinking large amounts of hyperosmolar fluids. Without a 
colon, he would be unable to reabsorb fluids and become 
dehydrated. Perhaps a small contribution was from a Crohn's 
flare but it was too mild to explain the large volume diarrhea. 
All other work up of infectious causes, short gut, and Crohn's 
were ruled out per below. Stool anion gap was indeterminant 
(neither secretory or osmotic). Prior infectious w/up was felt 
to be incomplete, thus aeromonas, coccidio, microsporidia etc in 
addition to repeat stool studies showed negative infection. 
Structural dz was evaluated at OSH, where patient underwent a 
repeat small bowel follow through showing enough small intestine 
to rule out short gut syndrome. This image was re-evaluated by 
in house radiologists in addition to the CT abd and suggested 
loops of small bowel swelling concerning for Crohn flare. He was 
taken for EGD and ileoscopy on ___ which showed erythema of 
the gastric and duodenal mucosa and friability of the ileum also 
concerning for Crohn flare. Biopsies showed no diagnostic 
abnormalities. Octretide was discontinued on ___ with normal 
resulting output volumes (but continued on loperamide). His diet 
was advanced to hypoosmolar diet on ___ which was well 
tolerated. He continued on TPN given his degree of malnutrition. 
His work up to rule out neuroendocrine tumor will continue as an 
outpatient. He will see Dr. ___ Dr. ___ in the coming 
weeks. He was discharged on TPN in order to treat his 
malnutrition and mitigate his fluid losses from dietary 
nonadherance. His GI doctors ___ the course of TPN. 

# ___ on CKD.  CKD likely due to DM2, Cr ___ was 2.2 and ___ 
was 2.7.  On admission Cr was 5.4 and patient had evidence of 
uremia (asterixis, encephalopathy, though some of this may be 
due to hyponatremia and acidosis).  This was felt to be of 
pre-renal etiology (UNa < 10).  Patient underwent aggressive 
volume repletion resulting in resolution of renal impairment. 

# Encephalopathy.  Toxic/metabolic.  
Duloxetine/fentanyl/tincture of opium were stopped.  With 
treatment of the above, his MS improved and his home fentanyl 
and gabapentin were restarted.  

# AG acidosis: Resolved with IVF rehydration.  Likely due to 
stoma output and ___. 
  
# Hyponatremia ___ hypovolemia, resolved with volume repletion.

# Chronic pain: Patient has chronic pain and neuropathy. He was 
managed on home dose fentanyl and codeine. Initially he received 
IV dilaudid then transition to PO oxycodone for breakthrough 
pain. 

INACTIVE ISSUES
# Insulin-dependent diabetes: Continue standing glargine 10U and 
sliding scale.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ from an outside hospital for further 
evaluation of your recurrent loose stools, dehydration and 
kidney damage. You were evaluated for Crohn flare with a repeat 
EGD and ileoscopy which showed mild inflammation in your small 
bowel, but Crohn's was not felt to be the cause of your 
symptoms, and nor was infection. Your diarrhea was felt by the 
gastroenterology team to be a secretory diarrhea of unclear 
cause. Your imaging from the outside hospital was also reviewed 
by our radiologists and we ruled out short gut syndrome. The 
gastroenterology team felt that you would benefit from an 
isotonic diet, small frequent meals, and you will need more 
investigation of your diarrhea. Specifically, you will need to 
return for an appointment with Dr. ___ will schedule 
further studies to evaluate your diarrhea. In the meantime we 
will keep you hydrated and nourished with TPN. 

You were treated with medication to decrease gastric secretions 
and the octreotide was stopped on ___ after your output 
decrease to normal volumes. A normal volume is less than 2 
liters daily. It is important to maintain a hypo-osmolar diet 
and to keep your food properly refrigerated. 

Your chronic pain was managed with home dose fentanyl patch, 
codeine and oxycodone for breakthrough pain. 

We have made some changes to your medications: 
STOPPED: Octreotide 

Please take all of your remaining prescriptions as previously 
presecribed. Should you develop any symptoms concerning to you, 
please call Dr. ___. 
 
Followup Instructions:
