History of Present Illness:
___ year old woman with history of stage II colon cancer s/p 
right hemicolectomy and chemo (___), chronic diarrhea, recent 
admission at ___ (___) with complicated 
diverticulitis with abscess s/p incomplete ___ drainage, who
presents as transfer from ___ with abdominal 
pain and complicated diverticulitis found to have new abscesses.

In recent ___ admission (___), she was found to 
have acute complicated diverticulitis with intra-abdominal fluid 
collections suspicious for abscesses. ___ drain was placed in 
pelvic collection, and it was draining frank pus. She was then 
sent to rehab (___ in ___ due to her leg weakness. 

By the end of her rehab stay, she was having a great of 
difficult walking, as well as diarrhea and a decreased appetite. 
She then went from her rehab to live with her daughter ___, 
her HCP, on ___. She had ___ services there but given her 
difficulty walking and weakness, her daughter did not feel 
comfortable
caring for her. From her daughter's home, she went to ___ 
___ due to her weakness. Per the daughter, she was 
observed for two days then sent to ___ in ___. The 
rehab facility physician was concerned about her nausea, 
vomiting, poor PO intake, and weakness and sent her to ___ 
___ again. 

Patient initially presented to ___ with 
reported concern of ongoing left lower quadrant abdominal pain 
and ongoing diarrhea. However, the patient denies ever endorsing 
abdominal pain and her HCP confirmed this. She has a complicated 
colonic history with prior recurrent C. difficile with recent 
test reportedly negative, prior episode of diverticulitis that 
was
complicated by multiple loculated fluid collections requiring 
percutaneous drainage. She has a history of colon cancer and is 
followed by Dr. ___ in the setting of prior partial colonic 
resection. 

At ___, she was noted to be hypokalemic and 
hypomagnesemic which were both repleted and was found to have 
mild ___. Patient also found to be somewhat confused, assumed to 
be metabolic encephalopathy. Patient was covered with Zosyn and 
Flagyl and transferred to ___ by request by patient as
she is followed here by colorectal surgery. 

In the ED, initial vitals: 97.5 76 154/60 16 96% RA

Exam notable for: Somewhat confused. Abdomen soft, 
non-distended,
non-tender

Labs notable for: K 3.3, lactate 1.4, WBC 5.7,

Imaging notable for:
OSH CT Abd/pelvis read: There is an end to side ilio colic 
anastomosis seen in the anterior abdomen. The residual colon is 
significantly tortuous. There is extensive diverticulosis. There 
is some wall thickening in the sigmoid colon. Along the right 
aspect of the sigmoid colon, adjacent to the uterine fundus and
inseparable from the fundus there is a fluid collection with 
air-fluid level measuring 2.9Ã-2.4Ã-2.1 cm. Additional 
collection along the posterior aspect the uterus measuring 
3.4Ã-2.5Ã-2.4 cm. A large deep pelvic collection is seen along 
the undersurface of the sigmoid colon, measuring 11.7Ã-8.8Ã-5.0 
cm. Some pelvic stranding is seen.

zosyn and vancomycin. They want to talk to ___ about drainage of 
her abscesses.  

On the floor, the patient says she has been having trouble 
walking over the last month that has been progressive. She was 
not able to say if her weakness was secondary to dizziness or 
decreased strength but thinks it is more decreased strength. She 
endorsed nausea and vomiting as well as a decreased appetite.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
================
___ CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST 
A 2 cm anterior pelvic collection has decreased in size since 
the reference study from yesterday and is not large enough to 
contain a drain, and no safe percutaneous approach could be 
identified. This contains oral contrast, suggestive of a 
contained perforation likely from the sigmoid colon. 2. A second 
3 cm collection at the cul de sac is unchanged in size but is 
not approachable for percutaneous drainage. 

___ TTE
The left atrial volume index is normal. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal dyskinesis of the 
basal half of the inferolateral wall (clip 50). The remaining 
segments contract normally (LVEF = 45 %). No intraventriuclar 
thrrombus is seen. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. 
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets 
are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

___ CXR
There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax identified. The size of the cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is within normal limits. Calcification of the aortic 
arch is again noted. The bones appear diffusely osteopenic. 

___ STRESS EKG
No anginal symptoms with uninterpretable ECG in the presence of 
baseline ECG abnormalities. Normal blood pressure with blunted 
heart rate response to the dobutamine/Atropine administration. 

___ STRESS ECHO
The patient received intravenous dobutamine beginning at 15 
mcg/kg/min, increasing to 30mcg/kg/min and 45 mcg/kg/min in 3 
minute stages plus 1.0 mg atropine. The exercise ECG was 
uninterpretable due to resting ST-T wave changes (see exercise 
report for details). There is normal resting blood pressure and 
normal blood pressure and blunted heart rate response to 
dobutamine. Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 68 
bpm and a blood pressure of 98/64 mmHg. These demonstrated basal 
inferolateral akinesis with normal contractility of other 
segments (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular free wall motion is 
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Doppler demonstrated 
trace aortic regurgitation with no aortic stenosis or 
significant mitral regurgitation or resting LVOT gradient. At 
mid-dose dobutamine [30 mcg/kg/min; heart rate 70 bpm, blood 
pressure 104/60 mmHg), there was appropriate augmentation of all 
left ventricular segments except no change in basal akinesis. . 
At peak dobutamine stress [45 mcg/kg/min and 1.0 mg atropine; 
heart rate 88 bpm, blood pressure 114/70 mmHg), there was 
appropriate augmentation of systolic function of all segments 
except no change in basal akinesis. 

___ ESOPHAGOGRAM
There are no esophageal strictures, ulcers or obstructing masses 
present. 
Tertiary contractions are consistent with presbyesophagus.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with background history of stage II colon cancer, status 
post right hemicolectomy and chemo (___), chronic diarrhea, and 
recent admission at ___ (___) with complicated 
diverticulitis with abscess, status post incomplete ___ drainage, 
who presents as transfer from ___ with abdominal pain and
complicated diverticulitis, found to have new abscesses as well 
as new weakness and poor PO intake thought to be secondary to 
severe depression, was started on antidepressive medications and 
appetite stimulants and now s/p PEG tube placement and for 
malnutrition with improvement in mood and nutritional status.

====================
ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
# Complicated diverticulitis with abscess
Patient presented with weakness and persistent diarrhea from 
___, where CT abdomen/pelvis showed multiple intra-abdominal 
abscesses. On prior admission, there were multiple similar 
loculated intra-abdominal collections. Plan with colorectal 
surgery at that time was to delay possible sigmoid resection to 
allow inflammation to improve. On this admission, patient 
commenced on ciprofloxacin/metronidazole and planned for ___ 
guided drainage of these abscesses. However, CT pelvis on ___ 
showed decrease in the size of the collections, now not amenable 
to drainage. Discussion was had between surgery, medicine, 
patient and her daughter on ___, as questions had been raised 
by daughter/HCP as to whether surgery was within patient's GOC. 
It was decided to defer surgery to address the ___ 
medical, nutritional, and psychosocial issues, given that it was 
unclear if surgical intervention would correct any of the root 
problems driving her current functional decline. It was also 
decided at this time to discontinue antibiotics given absence of 
systemic inflammatory symptoms. 

# Severe Malnutrition
# Weakness/Gait Instability
# Weight Loss
Patient presented with weakness as her main complaint on 
presentation to ___. This was in the setting of persistent 
nausea, and poor PO intake over the previous few weeks. 
Neurological examination was within normal limits, and remained 
so throughout admission. TSH 1.3 so not likely to cause 
weakness. Initially it was felt decreased PO intake due to 
nausea was likely secondary to persistent intra-abdominal 
collections. However, patient's nausea spontaneously resolved 
without final intervention on these abscesses. Despite small 
improvement in PO intake, she remained uninterested in food and 
required IVF for periods of relative hypotension. Mirtazapine 
was added with no effect. Nutrition followed closely and 
recommended tube feeding, but patient refused same. TPN was felt 
not to be a safe option, given her indolent infectious 
complications of diverticulitis, which theoretically may have 
carried a risk of bacterial translocation. Eventually after 
discussion with Ethics, patient and HCP eventually a g-tube was 
placed ___  and tube feeds were successfully initiated with 
good weight gain and patient cooperation.

# Depression
# Apathy to care
Throughout admission, the patient appeared pleasant and 
interactive, although deferred all medical decisions to her 
daughter/HCP, appeared fatalistic about her situation, and 
disengaged from medical decision making. Through discussion with 
daughter on ___ regarding decision-making capacity, the 
decision was made that the patient lacked capacity on ___. She 
was initiated on methylphenidate as a stimulant per psychiatric 
recommendation with improvement in mood. She was also continued 
on fluoxetine and mirtazapine. 

# T wave inversions
# CAD
EKG on ___ showed QTc of 431 and new T wave inversions but 
troponins were negative. A TTE showed normal left ventricular 
cavity size with focal systolic dysfunction and mitral 
regurgitation. A dobutamine stress test was done which showed 
probable prior myocardial infarction without inducible ischemia. 
The patient was started on ASA 81mg, metoprolol XL 25mg and 
continued on her home statin.

# Acute on chronic diarrhea
Patient complaining of diarrhea ___ times daily but has occurred 
for months. C diff was negative so home loperimide was resumed. 
The patient had reoccurrence of diarrhea after starting tube 
feeds, but this also resolved with increasing fiber content of 
tube feeds and with home loperamide. 

# Cellulitis
After G tube placement there was concern for cellulitis as the 
site of insertion was erythematous and the patient complained of 
abdominal pain. There was no purulence or induration, however 
patient had one recorded fever. She recieved Mupirocin cream and 
Clindamycin 300mg Q6H for 5d course (___).

# Staph Aureus UTI
During her hospital course the patient complained of dysuria and 
UA was done which showed bacteria, WBCs, and was nitrite 
positive. Cultures grew highly sensitive coag (+) staph aureus. 
The source of staph aureus was unclear, given this is not a 
usual pathogen from urinary tract. The patient was started on 
ceftriaxone (___) then transitioned to Bactrim based on 
sensitivities to complete 7 day course (___). BCx were 
negative and no signs of endocarditis or other deep seated 
infection. 

# Anemia
The patient had an acute drop in H/H on ___. There were no 
signs of an active bleed and her Hbg remained stable for the 
remainder of her stay. 

================
CHRONIC ISSUES
================
# Small ascites
Identified on prior admission CT. A sample was sent for 
microbiology but not cytology or cell counts/ fluid studies. 
Ascitic fluid was negative for infection prior admission.

# Hyperlipidemia
The patient was continued on home statin.

# Vitamin deficiency
We continued home cyanocobalamine and Vitamin D plus tube-feeds.

=====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=====================
[] Given small volume ascites and weight-loss consider ongoing 
malignancy work up.
[] Please monitor improvement in nutritional status after ___ 
months of tube feeds and optimization of depression regimen. If 
symptoms have improved can consider discontinuation of PEG. 
Current tube feed settings: Osmolite 1.5 @75 ml/hr x16 hours 
(1800 kcal/75 g protein) with 300ml of free water flushes Q4H
[]Monitor volume status as patient did require intermittent IVF 
when she had poor PO intake.
[] Ensure psychiatry follow up at time of discharge for 
optimization of medical regimen for depression treatment.  
[] Pleasure ensure colorectal follow up at time of discharge for 
further management of known diverticular disease. 
[] The patient was found to be HBV non immune, please consider 
vaccination.
[] The patient was started on omeprazole when she was initiated 
on tube feeds for management of GERD symptoms. Consider 
discontinuing the PPI if symptoms have resolved.
[] The patient's QTC was closely monitored because she received 
frequent Zofran due to nausea. Last QTc 446, please get EKG to 
reassess QTc prior to giving any QTc prolonging agents.
