Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:  
CT abdomen/pelvis ___ report: 
FINDINGS: 
In the liver there are now at least 5 low attenuation masses. 
The larger 2 measure 4.4 cm, previously measured 1.2 cm and 3.8 
cm which previously measured 1.4 cm. These are seen on image 24 
and image 44. 
New masss are present measuring 2.5 cm on image 31 and 1.3 cm 
and image 27 and a subcentimeter lesion on image 33. The common 
duct is very dilated mass measuring up to 2 cm with some 
intrahepatic ductal dilatation. This has been present previously 
but may be slightly worse. An ampullary lesion cannot be 
excluded. There is some sludge 
within the gallbladder. The pancreatic duct is mildly dilated, 
unchanged. The spleen and adrenal glands are normal. The right 
kidney is unremarkable. The Left kidney has a 1.4 cm 
hyperintense cyst unchanged. The small bowel and colon are 
normal in caliber and appearance. The prostate is enlarged with 
scattered calcifications. The prostate makes an impression upon 
the base of the bladder. 
The lung bases are clear. Bone windows do not demonstrate any 
suspicious lesions. There are extensive degenerative changes 
within the spine and within the hips, left worse than right. 
IMPRESSION: 
Multiple enlarging masses within the liver, very worrisome for 
metastatic disease. The common duct is quite dilated with some 
intrahepatic ductal dilatation and dilatation of the pancreatic 
duct, and ampullary lesion cannot be excluded. Otherwise there 
has been no significant interval change in the abdomen or 
Pelvis.

Colonoscopy: mass at 15cm. Stool passing through but near 
obstructive. 

Sigmoidoscopy ___:
A stenosis was at 15cm from the anal verge consistent with a 
malignant stricture. The scope did not traverse the lesion. A 
90cm by 22mm (WallFlex Colonic stent ___ metal 
stent was placed successfully. Under fluoroscopic guidance a 
standard 15 mm biliary extraction balloon was passed through the 
therapeutic upper endoscope into the colon traversing the 
stricture.  As contrast was injected a tight, 4cm, stenosis was 
seen.  The balloon catether was removed and 0.035 in x ___ cm 
Jagwire was left in place within the sigmoid colon.  An 
uncovered colonic metal stent was slowly advanced over the 
guidewire through the stricture under fluoroscopic 
visualization.  Final position of the stent was visualized on 
fluoroscopy and remained in excellent position traversing the 
stricture. Final fluoroscopic views show adequate luminal 
patency.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ with h/o Alzheimer's dementia, atrial 
fibrillation on Coumadin, colon cancer with metastatic disease 
to the liver, who p/w concern for bowel obstruction ___ cancer.  


#) Colon cancer with near-complete colon obstruction.  Pt/family

was stable and his VS were normal.  Counselled wife to call PCP 
or return to ED if having persistent bleeding or bright red 
blood.  They are being referred to palliative care through his 
PCP.

Counselled wife to restart ___ after bleeding stops.
