Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Mr. ___ was diagnosed pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to
the liver in ___ when he was admitted for painless
jaundice. CT showed 3.3cm pancreatic head mass and MRI
showed a 1.8cm left kidney lesion concerning for RCC as well as 
2
sub-cm liver masses. FNA of pancreas showed 'suspicious' cells.
His pancreatic mass was deemed unresectable due to abutting the
SMV and portal vein. He was treated with three cycles of
FOLFIRINOX ___ which was halted due to rising CA 
___
and increased size of liver metastases. In ___,  CA
___ elevated to 23K and considered potentially related to left
finger infection in setting of diabetes. Imaging shows increased
size of liver metastases. In ___ he started
gemcitabine/Abraxane. Imaging ___ showing slight decrease 
in
the size of the liver metastases with stable disease at the
pancreas. Course complicated by right thigh muscle infarct
presumed ___ diabetes in ___. Primary chemotherapy side
effect has been neuropathy on the bottoms of b/l feet without
impairment of ADLs. Has required multiple dose and schedule
adjustments in order to maximize quality of life, minimize 
marrow
toxicity and maintain control over tumor (primarily assessed by
tumor marker). Imaging has showed mixed response in early ___:
given discordance with ___, unclear if true progression vs
variations due to reduced chemotherapy exposure at various time
points for various toxicity and scheduling reasons. In setting 
of
increasing side effects and  mixed response by imaging/markers,
changed to CapOx on ___ scans show a mixed response to treatment, regimen
changed to modified FOLFIRINOX 
-___: Began modified FOLFIRINOX with dose reduction ___
IVP and Leucovorin held from regimen) (Per OMR, patient
previously given this regimine at ___ for 3 cycles ___ ago)
-___: CT scan showed progression of disease with an interval
increase in size of the innumerable  hepatic masses, increased
abnormal soft tissue in the retroperitoneum, and 
increasing ascites.
-___: Patient started on erlotinib with plan for C1D1 of
gemcitabine on ___.
-Admitted to ___ on ___ for hyperbilirubinemia, fevers, 
n/v,
and acute urinary retention.

IMAGING:
MRI Liver ___
Progression of disease with an interval increase in size of the
innumerable hepatic masses, increased abnormal soft tissue in 
the
retroperitoneum, and increasing ascites.  Additionally, the
primary pancreatic cancer in the pancreatic head is very
minimally increased in size.

CT CHEST w/ CON ___
New irregular nodule in the right upper lobe and interval
increase of the right lower lobe nodules concerning for
progressive metastatic disease. 

ERCP ___
EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at ___ MHz
frequency 
The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from the duodenal
bulb and the second / third duodenum.  
The body and tail [partially] were imaged from the gastric body
and fundus. 
Mass: A 3.5 cm X 4 cm ill-defined mass was noted in the head of
the pancreas.  
The mass was hypoechoic and heterogenous in echotexture.  
The borders of the mass were irregular and poorly defined.  
The mass is involving the confluence, especially the SMV with
narrowing of vessel diameter.  
FNB was performed. Color doppler was used to determine an
avascular path for needle aspiration. A 22-gauge needle with a
stylet was used to perform biopsy.  
Six needle passes were made into the mass.  
Biopsies were sent for pathology.  
Scan of the left hepatic lobe reveled multiple hypoechoic
lesions measured between 0.5-2cm, highly suspected for 
metastatic
disease, FNB was performed from 3 different hepatic lesions 
Otherwise normal upper eus to third part of the duodenum

CXR ___
1. Left PICC tip in the low SVC.  No pneumothorax. 
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, new in the interval, with
bibasilar atelectasis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ T2DM, HTN, DL and pancreatic cancer metastatic to the 
liver (biopsy proven), dx ___, currently on C1D10 
Gemcitabine and erlotinib, recent biliary sepsis s/p 
stent/completed abx
course for klebsiella bacteremia (last dose zosyn ___ who p/w 
leaking paracentesis site on his LLQ and increased anasarca with 
___ edema and new asymptomatic ___ pleural effusions, patient 
is now s/p therapeutic paracentesis ___. He was seen by his 
primary oncologist and will follow up with her on ___ and 
will continue with 1000 mg xeloda bid X 14 days, 7 days off and 
tarceva continuously once home delivery complete. 

# Increased Anasarca
# Ascites
# Leaking Paracentesis site
Since ___, pt has gained 24 lbs. Likely multifactorial, but will 
discuss w/ onc whether this maybe due to capillary leak syndrome 
from gemcitabine. Other causes include pancreatic ca, 
pseudocirrohsis from liver mets, protein calorie malnutrition, 
iatrogenic fluid overload from TPN. INR and LFTs largely stable 
w/o evidence of hepatic decompensation. He was started on lasix 
on most recent admission.
- home amlodipine, lisinopril held while patient was admitted so 
that diuretic regimen could be increased. started on 50mg daily 
and 20mg Lasix daily. TPN was held for contribution to fluid 
overload.  Patient underwent ___ guided therapeutic para  ___ 

# Pancreatic Ca
Diagnosed ___ stage 4, progressed on modified FOLFIRINOX, C1 
Gemzar ___ received erlotinib. Dr ___ followed 
through inpatient admission. Did not administer Gemcitabine 
while inpatient. pt will follow up as outpatient for 
Gemcitabine, dosing schedule per Dr. ___.
___ consider every other week dosing given significant fatigue, 
weigh benefits and AEs of chemo.
Continued Ritalin and Ativan prn, continued creon 2 caps w/ 
break, 2 w/ lunch, 1 w/ dinner, 0 w/ snacks

# Gastric/Duodenal outlet obstruction
# Protein Calorie Malnutrition. 
Per recent discharge note, he is not a candidate for duodenal 
stent given high likelihood of migration. He was started on TPN. 
SHould continue to evaluate contribution of TPN to fluid 
overload. TPN held during hospitalization for diuresis.

# Thrombocytopenia
This is most likely due to his hepatic disease and splenomegaly, 
as well as chemo. However there was c/f HIT on recent admission 
but ruled out. avoided hsq for now until further clarified w/ Dr 
___. continued TEDS

# Normocytic Anemia: due to inflammatory block from neoplasm and 
antineoplastic therapy

# Recent Klebsiella bacteremia: completed treatment course with 
Zosyn on ___. 

# T2DM: At home takes metformin w/ Glargine 10U w/ breakfast and 
ISS. Here will hold and keep only on ISS. Of note, he also has 
insulin in his TPN. 

# HTN: held amlodipine (which can cause ___ and lisinopril in 
favor of lasix and aldactone 
# Heart murmur: chronic x ___ years per his report
# BPH: cont tamsulosin bid.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for continued leakage after 
undergoing paracentesis. You had stitches placed to good effect 
to stop the leaking. While in the hospital, you underwent 
paracentesis with the interventional radiology team and your 
diuretics were increased to add spironolactone 50mg daily  on 
top of your furosemide 20 mg daily to prevent fluid from 
accumulating. You are now safe for discharge home with close 
follow up. 

We left a message with out TPN team to adjust and concentrate 
your home TPN. You should also follow up with Dr. ___ in 
___. You will continue your chemotherapy at home as planned 
until you get home delivery of xeldoa (1000 mg twice a day for 
two weeks on, then one week off) and Tarceva. 

It was  a pleasure caring for you - we wish you well!
Sincerely, 
Your ___ Oncology Team
