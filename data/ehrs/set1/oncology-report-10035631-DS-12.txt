dyspnea on exertion X 1 week and diffuse bilateral pulmonary 
opacities on imaging, concerning for organizing pneumonia versus 
an atypical infection. 

Mr. ___ reports that he was feeling well until one week prior

feeling of tightness in his chest. This passed but he 
subsequently has had a daily feeling of crackles or rattling in

RUQ ULTRASOUND
FINDINGS:  
The liver echotexture is normal. No concerning hepatic mass is 
detected. The main portal vein is patent, demonstrating proper 
hepatopetal flow. There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilation. 
The gallbladder is normal. The CBD is normal in caliber, 
measuring 3 mm. 
  
The pancreas is normal. There is no ascites. Included views of 
the IVC and aorta are within normal limits. The right and left 
kidneys measure 11.3 and 9.3 cm, respectively, without stone, 
mass, or hydronephrosis. The spleen is not enlarged, measuring 
10.5 cm. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Normal ultrasound appearance of the liver, gallbladder, and 
spleen. 

CXR ON ___
IMPRESSION: 
Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Multifocal mainly mid and 
lower lobe opacities are present on both PA and lateral view, 
with some peripheral and basal for disposition. There is no 
appreciable pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. 
  
The findings although potentially representing infectious 
process, can 
represent other etiologies for example cryptogenic organizing 
pneumonia or drug reaction. Giving the patient history, further 
assessment with chest CT is required. There is no pneumothorax. 
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema 

CHEST CT ON ___
IMPRESSION:  
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities predominantly in the lower 
lobes and at the periphery of the lungs, which may be seen with 
multifocal infection, such as a viral infection. In the setting 
of allogeneic bone marrow transplant and minimal patient 
symptoms, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, a diagnosis of 
exclusion, may be most likely in this situation. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
#SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Mr. ___ presented with dyspnea on 
exertion and findings on a CT of the Chest notable for diffuse 
bilateral opacities. Based on the imaging findings and his 
clinical status, the leading differential under consideration 
includes aspergillosis versus an organizing pneumonia, though 
atypical infectious etiologies such as a viral PNA or PCP are 
also being considered. Of note, he had discontinued prophylaxis 
with voriconazole about 3 weeks prior to this admission due to a 
transaminitis. He remained afebrile throughout the admission 
with an ambulatory oxygen saturation of 94%. He underwent a 
bronchoscopy on ___. Due to concern for aspergillosis as 
the cause of his symptoms, an ID Consult was requested. The 
patient had to leave the hospital before the ID recommendations 
could be finalized but their preliminary recommendation was that 
the patient be discharged on voriconazole 450 q12hrs X 1 day 
followed by 350mg q12hrs. They recommended this or another 
acceptable treatment for aspergillosis be continued until there 
is evidence of response or an alterative diagnosis had been 
identified. The biopsy results from his bronchoscopy were 
pending at the time of discharge. The Interventional Pulmonary 
Team recommended that Mr. ___ remain on lifelong prophylaxis 
for aspergillosis regardless of his final diagnosis.

#TRANSAMINITIS: Mr. ___ has had a transaminitis of uncertain 
etiology with an ALT and AST on this admission of 176 and 98, 
respectively. The differential for this problem may include GVHD 
of the liver, drug toxicity second to voriconazole or other 
biliary etiologies. Hepatology was consulted and recommended an 
abdominal ultrasound that showed a normal liver, gallbladder and 
spleen. Iron studies, Hepatitis labs and several Rheumatologic 
labs were ordered on their team's recommendation. Transaminitis 
downtrended without any intervention and on the day of discharge 
ALT was 101, AST was 43 and Alk Phos was 264. The plan was for 
Mr. ___ to follow-up on this problem in the outpatient 
___ clinic.

#MALE BREAST CANCER: Mr. ___ has male breast cancer ___ s/p 
mastectomy with a plan for tamoxifen. This was not started 
during his admission due to transaminitis.

#AML s/p alloBMT (day+261): Mr. ___ is s/p a matched related 
donor alloBMT for AML. While inpatient his Tacrolimus was 
continued at 0.5mg twice weekly (M/Th).  Acyclovir prophylaxis 
was also continued at 400mg q8hrs.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please follow-up bronchoscopy results including final BAL ___, 
galactomannan and Respiratory Viral Antigen Panel as well as 
final pulm tissue pathology
- Follow-up with ___ regarding appropriate 
- Plan to follow-up with Pulmonary regarding final results and 
treatment planning
- Plan to follow-up with Hepatology for further work-up of 
Transaminitis

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a privilege caring for you at ___. You came into the
