                          ========
TTE ___:
=============
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is normal. The right atrium is 
mildly enlarged. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional 
and global left ventricular systolic function. Quantitative 
biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 69 % (normal 
54-73%). Left ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 
L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. No ventricular septal defect is seen. Tissue Doppler 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP 
greater than 18 mmHg). Normal right ventricular cavity size with 
normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for 
gender with a mildly dilated ascending aorta. The aortic arch is 
mildly dilated with a normal descending aorta diameter. A ___ 
3 aortic valve bioprosthesis is present. The prosthesis is well 
seated with Leaflets not well seen with high gradient. There is 
trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are 
normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. 
There is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is borderline elevated. There 
is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior TTE (images not available for review) of 
___ , gradient is higher.
TTE: ___ (intra operative)
CONCLUSION:
Pre-TAVR: There is SEVERE aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0 
cm2 or less). There is mild [1+] aortic regurgitation.
Post-TAVR: The ___ 3 TAVR prosthesis is well seated 
with normal leaflet motion and normal gradient. There is a 
paravalvular jet of trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

***CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: ___
FINDINGS:  
There is no evidence of recent territorial infarct,intracranial 
hemorrhage,edema,or mass. There is mild prominence of the 
ventricles and 
sulci suggestive of involutional changes. No evidence of 
calvarial fracture.  Mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoidal 
air cells. The maxillary sinuses and mastoid air cells are 
clear. The orbits  are unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of recent territorial infarct.  No acute 
intracranial process. 

***EEG: (DATE) pending
  
MRI BRAIN: ___
There are multiple scattered foci of slow diffusion involving 
the bilateral 
frontal, left parietal, and left occipital lobes with multiple 
foci of slow 
diffusion in the right cerebellar hemisphere.  There are mild 
periventricular 
and subcortical foci of white matter T2/FLAIR signal 
hyperintensity, 
nonspecific but likely sequelae of chronic small vessel disease. 
 There is no evidence of hemorrhage,edema,masses, mass effect,or 
midline shift.   The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent 
suggesting age-related involutional changes. 
  
The major intracranial vascular flow voids are preserved.  
Orbits and 
visualized extracranial soft tissues are unremarkable. 
  
MRA BRAIN: Images are significantly motion degraded. 
There is possible multifocal narrowing of the bilateral 
posterior cerebral 
arteries with a fetal type origin of the right posterior 
cerebral artery, with assessment limited by motion artifact.  
However, this is not verified on the postcontrast MRA of the 
neck which includes the proximal posterior 
circulation..  There is mild atheromatous narrowing of the 
bilateral 
intracranial ICA and the distal MCA branches.  The intracranial 
vertebral and internal carotid arteries and their major branches 
otherwise appear normal without evidence of 
stenosis,occlusion,or aneurysm formation. 
  
MRA NECK: 
The right vertebral artery is diffusely small in caliber, 
anatomic variant, with dominant left vertebral artery.  There is 
possibly mild narrowing in the A1 segment at the right vertebral 
artery origin.  Otherwise, both vertebral 
arteries appear patent with no significant stenosis 
demonstrated.  Narrowing.  
There is irregular narrowing at the bilateral common carotid 
artery 
bifurcations with mild stenosis at the origin of the left 
internal carotid 
artery and moderate stenosis at the origin of the right external 
carotid 
artery.  The origins of the great vessels, subclavian and 
vertebral arteries otherwise appear patent bilaterally.  The 
common, internal and external carotid arteries otherwise appear 
patent. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Multiple scattered acute to subacute infarcts right 
cerebellar hemisphere, bilateral frontal, left parietal and left 
occipital lobes suspicious for a cardioembolic etiology.. 
2. Significantly motion degraded images of the intracranial 
arteries. 
3. Within the above-mentioned confines, there is mild 
atheromatous narrowing of the bilateral intracranial ICA and 
distal MCA branches with some areas of possible narrowing of the 
bilateral posterior cerebral arteries, which appear less 
pronounced on the postcontrast images and therefore probably 
exaggerated by motion artifact.. 
4. Otherwise patent circle of ___ without evidence of 
stenosis,occlusion,or aneurysm. 
5. Mild atheromatous narrowing the bilateral common carotid 
bifurcations with mild stenosis of the left internal carotid 
artery origin. 
6. Mild multifocal narrowing of the right cervical vertebral 
artery. 
7. Small caliber right vertebral artery and dominant left 
vertebral artery, anatomic variant. 
8. Otherwise patent bilateral cervical carotid and vertebral 
arteries without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or dissection. 

PROCEDURE:
==========
TAVR: ___
Gradients: Pre-Procedure
AV mean grad 47mmHg

Interventional Details
The patient was counseled extensively regarding the risks, 
benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and after answering 
all questions, the patient yielded informed consent. The patient 
was thereafter brought to
the catheterization laboratory and monitored anesthesia care was 
delivered. Preprocedural antibiotic was administered 
intravenously. The nature of this procedure required 
multidisciplinary planning and
management with the cardiac surgery, interventional cardiology 
and anesthesia physicians. All members of the heart team were 
present for the following key components of the procedure 
according ___ guidelines: Vascular access Catheter placement, 
Device implantation, Vascular closure, Intraprocedural 
medication ordering. Sterile technique was used throughout the 
case. All vascular access was obtained using modified Seldinger 
technique and ultrasound guidance. An ___ sheath was placed in 
the left
femoral vein and ___ sheaths were placed in the right and left 
femoral artery. The ___ sheath in the right femoral artery was 
removed and the arteriotomy was measured with the Manta device, 
and the access
site was upsized to an ___ sheath. A ___ Angled Pigtail catheter 
was advanced to the aortic root via the left femoral artery 
sheath and aortic root angiography was performed. A temporary 
pacing wire was placed in the right ventricle via the left 
femoral vein sheath. Next, the ___ sheath in the right femoral 
artery was exchanged over an Amplatz Extrastiff for the ___ 
sheath. A pigtail catheter was advanced to the aortic root. 
Using a 0.035" straight wire, the aortic valve was crossed. Over 
the wire, the angled pigtail catheter was advanced across the 
valve. Baseline hemodynamics (left heart catheterization) were 
obtained. A preshaped curved wire was advanced into the LV and 
the Al-1 catheter was removed. Next, the ___ delivery system 
was delivered to the descending aorta and the balloon positioned 
within the valve. We then proceeded to advance the ___ valve 
to the ascending aorta and to cross the aortic valve in a 
retrograde fashion. After confirming appropriate placement 
across the aortic valve using aortic root angiogaphy, the ___ 
valve was deployed with rapid ventricular pacing at 180 bpm.
Complications
There were no clinically significant complications.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for a trans catheter aortic valve replacement 
(TAVR) to treat your aortic valve stenosis which was done on 
___. By repairing the valve your heart can pump blood more 
easily and your chest pain should improve. 
 
 It is very important to take all of your heart healthy 
medications. In particular, you are now taking Aspirin and 
Clopidogrel (Plavix). These medications help to prevent blood 
clots from forming on the new valve. If you stop these 
medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot 
forming on your new valve. This could cause it to malfunction 
and it may be life threatening. Please do not stop taking 
Aspirin or Plavix without taking to your heart doctor, even if 
another doctor tells you to stop the medications.  

 You will need prophylactic antibiotics prior to any dental 
procedure. Please inform your dentist about your recent cardiac 
procedure, and obtain a prescription from your doctor before any 
procedure.  

 Please weigh yourself every day in the morning after you go to 
the bathroom and before you get dressed. If your weight goes up 
by more than 3 lbs in 1 day or more than 5 lbs in 3 days, please 
call your heart doctor or your primary care doctor and alert 
them to this change. Your weight at discharge is 252 pounds.  
 
 We may have made changes to your medication list, so please 
make sure to take your medications as directed. You will also 
need to have close follow up with your heart doctor and your 
primary care doctor.  

 If you were given any prescriptions on discharge, any future 
refills will need to be authorized by your outpatient providers, 
primary care or cardiologist.  

 The Structural Heart team should be calling you with a follow 
up/echo in 1 month if you don't have one scheduled already. If 
you don't hear from them by next week, please call ___. 
 

 If you have any urgent questions that are related to your 
recovery from your procedure or are experiencing any symptoms 
that are concerning to you and you think you may need to return 
to the hospital, please call the ___ Heart Line at 
___ to speak to a cardiologist or cardiac nurse 
practitioner.  

 It has been a pleasure to have participated in your care and we 
wish you the best with your health.
