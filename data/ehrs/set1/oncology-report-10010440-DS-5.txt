History of Present Illness:
History obtain largely from Daughter in law and PCP, ___ (___)

History of Present Illness:  This is a ___ yo ___ female with a
history of a ___ secondary to an aneurysm with residual aphasia,
HTN, and hyperlipidemia and recent work-up initiated for 
multiple
myeloma who presents with leg weakness and multiple falls. 

Per the patient's daughter in law on ___ the patient had a
bad fall at home where she lives with her son and daughter in
law. She was down for 4 hours. She reported to her PCP that her
"legs gave out". She was seen at ___ where she had
plain films and a head CT that were normal. She received 6 weeks
of home ___ and was doing fairly well. When that concluded 
though,
she began a slow decline. She has had decreased appetite, a 
rapid
30 lbs weight loss and a few more falls.  She complains of back
pain and it is unclear whether pain or weakness has been the
cause of her falls. She also became incontinent of urine, but 
not
stool. Ultimately, 2 weeks ago when she could not even walk two
steps she went back to the ED where Xrays were negative. She 
went
to rehab. A CT was not done. At the nursing home rehab she
continued to have pain and weakness with not much improvement. 

Last night the patient was much more quiet than usual. This AM
she woke upset and in a lot of pain. She was screaming and
refusing to take her medications. The daughter encouraged the
rehab nursing home to send her to the ED. At the ___ ED she
received a spine CT that revealed, "Findings consistent with
multiple myeloma involving multiple levels and an associated 
mass
arising from T12 extending into the canal and compressing the
thecal sac significantly." Of note the patient can not have an
MRI due to the aneurysm clips. A left toes fracture was also
found on plain films.  The patient was sent to ___ for further
evaluation and treatment.

In the ED now the patient is in some mild pain, but reports
feeling ok.  Of note a year ago the patient began a w/u for
multiple myeloma. She had a biopsy done of the T12 lytic lesion
that was inconclusive. She then had a bone marrow biopsy that
revealed pre Kappa light chains, but no conclusive evidence of
multiple myeloma.

Bone, T12 vertebra, lytic lesion; Bone and fibrous tissue with 
dense plasma cell infiltrate, consistent with plasma cell 
dyscrasia, see note.

___ ANKLE (AP, LAT & OBLIQU) FINAL
There are moderate degenerative changes of the tibiotalar joint 
with narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. There is evidence of 
prior avulsive injury arising off the medial malleolus and 
likely the lateral malleolus as well. There is chronic deformity 
of the lateral malleolus. No acute fracture is identified. There 
is calcaneal enthesopathy. Soft tissue swelling is noted.
IMPRESSION: Moderate tibiotalar joint degenerative change. No 
acute fracture appreciated.

___ CT HEAD
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage status post right 
craniotomy and aneurysm clipping.    
2.  Hyperdensity of the left posterior cerebral hemisphere not 
corresponding to vascular territory could conceivably represent 
retained contrast related to the patient's recent myelogram.  
Attention on followup is recommended.  
3.  Stable bifrontal encephalomalacia.  
4. Unchanged position of a right parietal ventriculostomy 
catheter.  

___
TECHNIQUE:  Thoracolumbar spine, five views.   
FINDINGS:  The patient is status post posterior fusion from T10 
through L2 with a T12 corpectomy including placement of a 
vertical fusion spacer.  Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes 
are incompletely characterized, but suspected, along the facet 
joints along the mid through lower lumbar spine. Small anterior 
osteophytes are present along the lower thoracic spine.  There 
is no evidence for hardware loosening.  A PICC line terminates 
in the upper right atrium.  A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is also 
noted. 
IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable post-operative appearance. 

___ MRI SPINE
IMPRESSION: 
Status post T12 corpectomy and T10-L2 fusion. 
Posterior and right-sided intraspinal fluid collection 
communicates through the laminectomy defect and causes anterior 
and left lateral displacement of the thecal sac.  This leads to 
severe encroachment on the distal spinal cord. There are no 
findings to suggest tumor in this location.  The signal 
intensity characteristics are typical of simple fluid, rather 
than hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ h/o of stroke ___ years ago with baseline of expressive 
aphasia and RLE weakness, although family claims that she can 
fully comprehend. Pt was found to have T12 mass concerning for 
malignancy in ___, however bx of mass and BM was 
inconclusive.  She was asymptomatic at that time and family 
decided not to persue further work-up.  Pt now p/w with a 2.5 
month h/o of progressive weakness and recurrent falls 
unresponsive to ___, and weight loss from 250-->225.  Pt had CT 
at OSH which demonstrated expanding lesion at T12 and was 
subsequently given 10mg IV dexamethasone and transfered to ___ 
for further management.  Patient arrived on the floor afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  Immediate neurology and 
neurosurgery consults were obtained.  Her hospitalization course 
is as follows:

# T12 lesion: Patient has profound lower extremity weakness 
bilaterally, some of which is baseline from her previous CVA. 
Her right sided neuro exam is notable for hyperreflexia and 
clonus which is likely left over from her distant stroke. She 
was continued on dexamethasone and ISS while on the high dose 
steroids.  The patient was also given a TLSO brace for 
ambulation (although initially in too much pain to ambulate), 
and the head of her bed was kept at <45 degrees.  She received a 
pre-op myelogram, consistent with an expanding T12 lesion from 
prior imaging.  She was subsequently taken for decompression 
surgery by Ortho-Spine Team (s/p T10-L2 fusion, T12 Corpectomy) 
and transferred to the Ortho-Spine service for post-op 
management for two days.  When she returned to the medicine 
service on POD2, the patient was unable to move her lower 
extremities bilaterally.  Ortho-spine service indicated that the 
patient required additional pain control.  After consult with 
Neuro-Onc, the patient was transitioned from dexamethasone 10mg 
Q8 hours to dexamethasone 4mg BID on POD4.  She was transferred 
to the Neurology service for better management of her leg 
weakness.  It was felt this was likely due to post-op pain and 
inability for her to express her pain level due to her aphasia.  
Her medications were titrated and she did better on a higher 
dose fentanyl patch with immediate release morphine and tylenol 
for breaththrough pain.  Subsequently her leg movements improved 
on better pain control.  She will require XRT for her other bony 
lesions, and will need to follow up in ___ clinic 
after XRT (to be arranged by XRT).
  
# FED/GI: Patient was found to initially have very mild 
hypercalcemia on admission. She was NPO for procedure and 
started on maintenence fluids overnight however did not require 
agressive IVF. At the time of surgery, her hypercalcemia 
resolved.  She was advanced to a dysphagia diet post-operatively 
and did well on that for the rest of her course.  Electrolytes 
were stable with the exception of potassium which kept returning 
falsely elevated from hemolosis when drawn off her PICC.
 
# Foot Fracture: The patient was found to have R foot fracture 
involving the base of the fifth proximal phalanx with extension 
to the fifth MTP joint.  This was consistent with repeat imaging 
at ___.  Her L foot and ankles were also imaged because the pt 
was complaining of additional pain, however, films did not 
reveal any additional acute fractures.  The feet were vascularly 
intact.  Orthopedics recommended a hard sole boot for when the 
patient became ambulatory, otherwise, no intervention necessary. 


# Pain: Patient was found in extreme pain when transfered back 
to medicine service on POD2.  Unclear of origin as patient has 
difficulty communicating due to her aphasia. Patient's pain was 
controlled with standing acetaminophen, oxycodone, oxycontin, 
fentanyl patch and dilaudid IV PRN.  The pain team was also 
consulted to help manage her pain.  She was able to come off the 
oxycontin on a higher dose of fentanyl patch, and had PO ___ 
oxycodone and tylenol for break through pain.

# Encephalopathy: On POD2, there was noted an increase in 
aphasia, and confusion, which was difficult to assess given 
baseline communication issues. HCHCT for acute bleed was 
negative. The Pt was afebrile and infectious work-up including 
UA was neg. Urine Ctx and blood ctx were negaitve for occult 
infection.  Her mental status improved with better pain control. 
 She got a little worse on ___ and was subsequently found to 
have a new UTI (E Coli), which improved after treating with 
first ceftriaxone and then Bactrim when sensitivies returned 
pan-sensitive.

# Hct Drop: The patient Hct dropped from 32 on POD1-->22 on 
POD2, Hemavac drained only 185cc, pt responded appropriately to 
2U PRBC.  Unclear where bleed is.  Patients Hct subsequent 
remained stable after transfusion.  A T&L MRI revealed:
"Posterior and right-sided intraspinal fluid collection 
communicates through 
the laminectomy defect and causes anterior and left lateral 
displacement of 
the thecal sac.  This leads to severe encroachment on the distal 
spinal cord.  
There are no findings to suggest tumor in this location.  The 
signal intensity 
characteristics are typical of simple fluid, rather than 
hemorrhage."  Her Hct remained stable and the ultimate source of 
her Hct drop was never identified but felt to be possibly due to 
post-op hemolysis.  The fluid collection was discussed with 
ortho spine service who felt it could be conservatively watched 
for now (likely just post-surgical changes).

# History of Stroke: The patient was continued on home dose of 
aggrenox until the time of her surgery.  When the patient was 
transfered back to Medicine on POD2, the aggrenox was held.  It 
was restarted on ___ at the consent of orthopedics team.

# HTN: The patient was continued on home dose of losartan, 
diltiazem and atenolol  

# HLD: The patient was continued on her home dose of pravastatin 


# ID: UTI discovered ___eveloped foul smelling 
urine and WBC bumped to 22 (but this was felt to partially be 
due to her dexamethasone as well).  Treated with first 
Ceftriaxone, then Bactrim, and culture grew out pan-sensitive E 
Coli.  

# Access: Pt had a PICC line placed and confirmed in good 
position early on in her hopspitalization.  Due to initial 
concerns with dysphagia and patient frequently spitting out her 
meds, we decided to keep her steroids IV to ensure she received 
this crucial medication post-operatively. Once she has started 
radiation therapy, however, the PICC may come out and the IV 
steroids may be converted to the PO form.
