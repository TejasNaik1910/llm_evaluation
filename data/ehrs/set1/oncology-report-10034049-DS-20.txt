Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  
=====================  
___ year old lady with complex medical history including chronic 
pain/rheumatoid arthritis on prednisone, leukocytoclastic 
vasculitis, uterine cancer s/p hysterectomy, recent CVA in 
___, recently admitted for abdominal pain concerning for 
pyelonephritis, who represented with worsening of her 
periumbilical abdominal pain and back pain. She was found to 
have an abnormal lucency on L4/L5 on CT scan with c/f chronic 
osteomyelitis/discitis vs severe degenerative joint disease. She 
underwent ___ spine biopsy of the lesion, with cultures negative 
to date. 
 
ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:  
======================
# Back pain
# L4/L5 lesion 
Due to complaints of back pain and abdominal pain (as below), 
patient underwent CT A/P  that noted a lucency on L4/L5 c/f 
chronic discitis/osteomyelitis vs severe DJD. This was in the 
setting of one positive blood culture with strep viridans. MRI 
was recommended for further evaluation; however, patient 
refused. Repeat blood cultures were all negative; it is possible 
strep viridans could have represented contaminant. However, 
repeat CRP obtained this admission elevated at 90 (WNL at 
presentation, and also normalized later this admission without 
intervention).  ID was consulted and recommended intervertebral 
disc biopsy and cultures. We deferred MRI based on ID and 
radiology recommendations that a negative MRI would not 
definitively rule out osteomyelitis (would also show 
inflammation even if it were DJD). We proceeded with ___ spine 
biopsy on ___ with both the patient and the patient's HCP 
agreeing with the procedure; the patient did not require 
chemical sedation prior to the procedure. Gram stain 
demonstrated 3+ polymorphonuclear cells. Cultures are negative, 
though acid fast culture and fungal culture are still 
preliminary results.  Patient was discharged afebrile and 
clinically stable to a rehabilitation facility with plan to 
follow up on final culture results. ID (attending Dr. ___ 
___ was aware of discharge plan and in agreement; ID has 
low suspicion for infection at this point and recommend no 
antibiotics. Plan is for ongoing monitoring of her symptoms and 
clinical status at rehab/as an outpatient; if there is any 
recurrent concern for infection (fevers, worsening symptoms, 
persistently elevated CRP, etc), she should be referred to see 
Dr. ___ (ID fellow) as an outpatient. 

# Hypothyroidism: 
Patient exhibited symptoms of depression and withdrawal in the 
setting of hypothyroidism (___: 98). Of note, the patient is 
known to have hypothyroidism non-compliant on levothyroxine. 
Last hospital admission (___), TSH: 43, fT4: 0.7. On this 
hospital admission, TSH was initially found to be 98. She was 
continued on 150 mcg daily. IV levothyroxine was considered; 
however, patient was unwilling to undergo pIV placement and HCP 
was not established at that time. ___ on ___ was 33 and 
patient was continued on PO regimen at 137 mcg daily, with 
endocrinology input. She will need to follow up with 
endocrinology ___ weeks after discharge for repeat TFTs at that 
time. 

# Abdominal pain
Patient complained of diffuse abdominal pain that increased with 
food intake and decreased when applying heat. Patient underwent 
CT A/P in ED due to abdominal pain. Imaging noted possible 
lucency on L4/L5 c/f discitis/osteomyelitis (see back pain/GPC 
bacteremia above). The patient refused MRI and IV medications. 
Bowel regimen was initiated with patient demonstrating relief 
from abdominal pain after bowel movements. Abdominal pain was 
possibly related to constipation. She did not have abdominal 
pain by discharge. 

# Health care proxy (HCP)
# Patient refusal of care 
The patient declined  IV therapy during the majority of her 
hospitalization. She also refused most blood tests.  The patient 
has one biological child: ___, and two step children: 
___ and ___. In ___, ___ was the health care proxy 
but was changed one month later to son ___ was 
contacted but stated she did not wish to serve the role of HCP.  
Following meeting with ___, we filed for HCP affirmation. 
___ was established as HCP on ___ and was kept informed of 
all medical decision making throughout the patient's 
hospitalization. 

# Weight loss
Endorses unintentional weight loss. Per OMR sheets, her standard 
bed weight was 193 lbs on ___ and down to 171 lbs on ___. 
Nutrition was consulted but it was felt that tube feeds would be 
unfeasible given patient's failure to comply with medical 
interventions and refusal to discuss nutritional intervention. 
We encouraged PO intake throughout the hospitalization, provided 
a multivitamin with minerals and initiated mirtazapine to 
stimulate the patient's appetite. She will need to follow up 
with her PCP outpatient regarding this weight loss. 

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: 
=======================
# Prediabetes: HbA1c 6.1% on last admission.
Patient's home metformin was held while inpatient and restarted 
for discharge. 
 
# Hyperlipidemia: 
# History of CVA:
Patient was continued home atorvastatin  and aspirin.

# Rheumatoid arthritis: 
Patient was continued on home prednisone 5 mg daily, home 
tylenol, home methadone. 

# Depression and anxiety
Patient was continued on home sertraline 200 mg daily 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

discharge is being arranged with ___ MD. ___ will

discharge and is working on an appointment. Please call ___ 
endocrinology department if you do not hear back with an 
appointment time within the next 3 days.

[] Follow up on finalized spine biopsy cultures (fungal cultures 
and acid fast cultures were still preliminary negative at time 
of discharge) ___

loss and consider referral to outpatient nutrition if patient 
amenable
