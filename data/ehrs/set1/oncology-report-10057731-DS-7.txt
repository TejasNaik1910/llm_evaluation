MRCP ___: Results
IMPRESSION:   
1. 6.0 cm centrally necrotic mass in the tail the pancreas
obliterating the splenic vein, intimately associated with the
splenic artery, and abutting but not clearly involving the
inferior aspect of the stomach, consistent with primary
pancreatic neoplasm. No extension to the splenic hilum. 
2. Numerous hepatic metastases including to the hepatic hilum
causing diffuse intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation and
multifocal areas of intrahepatic iliary ductal tree stricturing,
including involving the left and right anterior and posterior
hepatic ducts as well as more distal segmental biliary 
tree branches. 
3. Peribiliary enhancement is concerning for superimposed
cholangitis. 
4. Enlarged periportal lymph nodes are concerning for nodal
metastases. 
5. Right portal vein is occluded. Patent left and main portal
vein. Patent SMV. 
6. Upper abdominal varices are noted including along the lesser
curvature of the stomach. No splenomegaly or ascites. 
7. 2 cm right adrenal adenoma. Other incidental findings, as
above. 

ERCP ___
The scout film was normal. 
There was mild duodenitis. 
The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome. 
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the
ducts. 
Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. The CBD was 6 mm
in diameter. 
Opacification of the gallbladder was incomplete. 
There was evidence of a hilar stricture involving both the CHD,
as well as left and right main intrahepatic ducts. 
The total length of the stricture was 3 cm. 
This is compatible with a Type IV hilar stricture. 
A biliary sphincterotomy was made with a sphincterotome. 
There was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding. 
Both the right and left IHD were cannulated with wires using
standard double-wire technique. 
A 6 mm hurricane dilation balloon was used to dilaton the right
and left main ducts as well as CHD. Cytology brushings of the
hilum were performed. 
A ___ x 15 cm biliary plastic straight stent was placed into 
the
right IHD. 
An 8.5 F x 14 cm biliary plastic straight stent was attempted 
to
be placed into the left IHD but was unable to traverse the
stricture and thus was removed with a snare. 
A ___ x 14 cm biliary plastic straight stent was then placed 
into
the left main IHD successfully after repeat hurricane dilation
with 6 mm balloon. 
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically 
and
fluoroscopically. 
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

EUS ___
Impression: A focused EUS was performed using a linear
echoendoscope at ___ MHz frequency: The head and uncinate
pancreas were imaged from the duodenal bulb and the second /
third duodenum. The body and tail [partially] were imaged from
the gastric body and fundus.
Pancreas Tail Mass: A 6 cm X 7 cm ill-defined mass was noted in
the tail of the pancreas. The mass was hypoechoic and
heterogenous in echotexture. The borders of the mass were
irregular and poorly defined.
FNB was performed of the mass. Color doppler was used to
determine an avascular path for needle aspiration. A 22-gauge
Sharkcore needle with a stylet was used to perform biopsy. Four
needle passes were made into the mass. 
25 gauge FNA was also performed of the mass with two passes.
No appreciable liver lesions were identified for biopsy.
Otherwise normal upper eus to third part of the duodenum

Discharge Instructions:
Mr ___,

You were admitted for abdominal pain and jaundice. It was found 
that you had a large mass in your pancreas that looks like it 
had spread to your lymph nodes and to your liver. During you 
stay you had an MRI of your biliary system and also a procedure 
called an ERCP in which we took biopsies of your lesion and also 
brushings of your bile duct. We stented your bile duct so it 
should be draining OK. 

The ERCP team want to see you back in 4 weeks to re-evaluate and 
pull the stent.

The final results of the brushings and samples taken will be 
followed up by oncology. Please expect a call from them or call 
them within 1 week of discharge.
You were also started on Lovenox for a clot in your right portal 
vein.

It was a pleasure  being part of your care
Your ___ Team
