status.

Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F with PMHx significant for multiple 
AVM and a seizure disorder who presented with hypoxia and AMS.  
Per the patient, she states her SOB started on ___ but has 
been progressing over the past year. Over the weekend she was 
not feeling like herself.  Her son had been trying to convince 
her to go to the hospital.  Apparently she had routine labs 
drawn at her PCPs office last week after starting ACEI for her 
hypertension and he had tried to contact her but she did not 
hear her voicemail.  Her son was increasingly concerned that she 
was confused and reportedly got in touch with her PCP who 
recommended that she come to the emergency room.

In the ED, initial vitals were 96.6 93 169/78 32 50% RA.  
She placed on nasal cannula and then facemask with improvement 
in her oxygenation. Labs were notable for negative troponin and 
elevated BNP. CXR was notable for engorged pulmonary vasculator 
and she received 20mg IV lasix in the ED. Her mental status 
reportedly improved while in the ED after receiving oxygen 
therapy. 

On arrival to the floor, initial vitals were T 98.3, BP 172/67, 
HR 85, RR 26, O2 sat 90% on 12L ___ mask.  She was triggered 
shortly thereafter for continued hypoxia and concern for 
somnolence.   Respiratory therapy was called for possible 
initiation of BiPAP or CPAP given likely underlying obstructive 
lung disease and possible OSA.  Prior to transfer to the ICU, 
patient was alert and oriented x3.  She was satting 100% and 
repeat ABG showed ___.  

In the MICU, she was put on BiPAP.  She was intermittently 
desatting to low ___ and having apneic episodes as long as ten 
seconds.  When alert, she noted that she has had a cough 
productive of gray sputum.  She denies hemoptysis.  She has had 
no weight loss, fevers or nightsweats.  She has no chest pain. 

 
Past Medical History:
- Epilepsy, complex-partial; followed by Dr. ___ seizures  
characterized by head turn to the right with impaired ability to 
speak but maintains awareness; this lasts for ___ minutes,  
followed by emotional crying, and then headache and nausea. Last 
seizure was > ___ years ago.  
- AVM, Left frontal, s/p Proton beam radiation at ___ in ___  
and  
again ___  
- PCom aneurysm s/p clipping at ___ in ___  
- HLD  
- Lumbar disc herniation, presented with left sciatic pain but  
none recently

MICROBIOLOGY:

IMAGING:
CXR ___
IMPRESSION:  
Slight prominence of the hila suggest pulmonary vascular 
engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.  Basilar atelectasis 
without definite focal consolidation. 

CTA Chest ___
IMPRESSION:  
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
2. Sclerotic lesions in the T11 vertebral body as well as the 
manubrium on the left.  8 mm the right upper lobe pulmonary 
opacity. 5 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. Moderate 
mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement.  These findings 
are concerning for possible malignancy. Given the sclerotic 
nature of the bony lesions, occult lung or breast malignancy or 
lymphoma should be considered. Alternatively the central lymph 
node enlargement can be seen in sarcoidosis or possibly 
lymphoma. 
3. Bilateral adrenal thickening, indeterminate but no focal 
lesions; most 
likely hyperplasia. 

CT Head noncontrast ___
IMPRESSION:  
The previously seen AVM is grossly similar in size compared to 
___. Since this scan was done recently after a CTA of the 
chest, residual IV contrast is seen within the head, and a small 
hemorrhage cannot accordingly be ruled out. No evidence of new 
mass effect or midline shift. 

ECHO ___
Conclusions  
The left atrium is mild to moderately dilated. No atrial septal 
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global 
systolic function (LVEF>65%). Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. The right ventricular cavity appears dilated with 
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is 
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely 
represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global 
systolic function. Right ventricular cavity mildly dilated with 
normal systolic function. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
the right ventricle now appears dilated in the subcostal views 
(not well seen in the apical views). Other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F with PMHx significant for multiple 
AVM and a seizure disorder who presented with hypoxia and AMS, 
triggered on floor for continued hypoxia and lethargy.  

# AECOPD and ACUTE DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE:  Patient presented 
with acute hypoxia, confusion.  The etiology of her hypoxia was 
thought to be multifactorial.  The elevated BNP on presentation 
was concerning for heart failure and pulmonary edema. She was 
diuresed with small lasix bolus in the ED and did show some 
improvement in oxygenation.  Her heavy smoking history, evidence 
of chronic bronchitis and emphsyematous changes on CT, lack of 
significant pulmonary consolidation, wheezing and hypercarbia 
were concerning for obstructive lung process leading to CO2 
retention and hypoxia.  Her body habitus and witnessed apneic 
events (both central and obstructive) are concerning for both 
sleep apnea.  She was ruled out for PE by CTA.  As she was 
diuresed and received BiPAP her oxygenation and mental status 
improved. She was able to be weaned off to a Venturi mask with 
FiO2 of 50%. Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizations as well as 
a 5 day course of azythromycin and prednisone were started for a 
COPD exacerbation.  Her oxygen requirements continued to 
decrease without further diuresis until she was on nasal 
cannula.  She was then called out to the floor where she was 
continued on oxygen but noted clinical and subjective 
improvement in respiratory status. She was evaluated by physical 
therapy who felt that she would benefit from ___ rehab for 
oxygen teaching and gait training in setting of using home O2.

# PULMONARY NODULES AND MEDIASTINAL LYMPHADENOPATHY AND BONE 
LESIONS:Concerning for a malignancy with metastatic disease.  
Differential includes lung primary vs. lymphoma vs. metastatic 
disease from another site such as breast.  Patient was informed 
of the findings. Her LDH was normal, and reported no B-symptoms. 
Her heavy smoking history puts her at increased risk of lung 
cancer but also other malignancies.  She reports that her 
colonoscopy was up to date but that she has not had a mammogram 
in many years.  She underwent transbronchial biopsy of hula 
lymph node, which returned negative for malignant cells. She has 
outpatient follow-up with Pulmonary at which time a decision 
will need to be made about the need for further imaging or 
tissues sampling.

# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Creatinine elevated to 1.3 on 
presentation compared to baseline of 1.0 less than a year prior. 
 She may have pre-renal azotemia due to HF or medication side 
effect (recent initiation of lisinopril)  Patient was diuresed 
and lisinopril was held.  Her creatinine returned to baseline of 
0.9-1.0.

# HYPERTENSION:  Not well controlled on presentation.  ACEI held 
on presentation given her hyperkalemia and ___.  She was started 
on Amlodipine 5mg daily and uptitrated to 10mg daily with good 
response.

# COMPLEX SEIZURE DISORDER:  Patient on admission had her 
medications with her, which were further confirmed with her 
outpatient Neurologist.  She had a phenytoin level on admission 
that was low but her outpatient Neurologist recommended no 
adjustments to her current medication regimen.  She continued 
her home medications and had no evidence of seizure this 
admission.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 

___ was a pleasure meeting you and taking care of you during your 
hospitalization. You were admitted for difficulty breathing that 
we think was caused by a problem called "Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease" or COPD. This is usually caused by a history 
of smoking and causes the airways to narrow when irritated, 
making breathing difficult. We gave you an antibiotic and 
steroids to decreased inflammation in your lungs. We also gave 
you inhaled medications to open your airways. You were kept on 
oxygen during your hospitalization and will need to go home on 
home oxygen therapy. You should followup with your new 
pulmonologist for further treatment. While you are on oxygen it 
is very very important that you do not smoke as this can be very 
dangerous. 

During your hospitalization, you were noted to have enlarged 
lymph nodes and nodules in your lungs. We biopsied the lymph 
nodes in your lungs but at the time of discharge, the pathology 
results were not back on this tissue. There results will be back 
when you followup with your new pulmonologist.  

We wish you the best, 

Your ___ team 
 
Followup Instructions:
