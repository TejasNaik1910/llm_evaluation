REPORTS
==========================
RUQUS at ___
Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed moderate intrahepatic and
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation with cause not identified.
Further evaluation with CT or MRI/MRCP recommended. Distended
gallbladder containing small amount of sludge. No definite
sonographic evidence of acute cholecystitis

MRCP ___. 3.0 x 2.6 cm ill-defined mass-like region of hypointense 
signal on T1 weighted imaging and hypoenhancement in the 
pancreatic head with restricted diffusion.  Findings could 
reflect lymphoma, especially in the setting extensive 
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, or an inflammatory process such 
as autoimmune pancreatitis.  Metastatic disease or primary 
pancreatic malignancy are also considerations but the latter is 
less likely given the absence of upstream pancreatic ductal 
dilatation.  Correlate with biopsy/cytology.  Depending on the 
results, short-term imaging follow-up may be helpful. 
2. Extensive retroperitoneal adenopathy, differentials include 
metastatic disease versus lymphoma. 
3. Common bile duct stent in place.  Enhancement of the biliary 
duct and pneumobilia, likely reflect post procedural change. 
4. 6 mm pancreatic cystic lesion, likely a side-branch IPMN. 
5. Pancreas divisum. 

ERCP ___
A single stricture that was 15 mm long was seen at the lower 
third of the common bile duct. There was moderate 
post-obstructive dilation.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using 
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Cytology samples were obtained using a brush in the lower third 
of the common bile duct.
A 8cm by ___ ___ biliary stent was placed successfully 
in the main duct.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old man with a history of bladder cancer with urostomy 
who presents with acute onset of painless jaundice. CT at OSH 
showed retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

An ERCP was performed on ___ and a stent was placed. Brushings 
were taken from the bile duct. The bilirubin downtrended after 
stent was placed. An MRCP was performed, which showed a mass in 
the head of the pancreas.

OTHER PROBLEMS
============================
# RP Lymph Nodes:  Concern for malignancy.  Ongoing discussion 
and workup as outpatient, consider LN Biopsy as outpatient

# Microcytic anemia: Continue home iron

# CKD:  Renal function at baseline and did not improve with IV 
fluid
  
# Metabolic acidosis:  Likely due to CKD
 
# T2DM:  A1C 6.4%.  Diet controlled.

# Recent UTI:  No growth on urine culture on admission.  
Antibiotics were stopped.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=============================
- Pt to be discussed at ___ pancreatic conference 
during the evening of ___.  He will be contacted with the f/u 
plan re: the pancreatic mass and painless jaundice
- F/u cytology as outpatient, pending on discharge
- F/u CA ___ as outpatient, pending on discharge
- Consider RP Lymph Node Biopsy as outpatient
- Repeat ERCP in 1 month for assessment of biliary tree and 
stent removal.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with jaundice (yellow skin), in the setting of 
having known enlarged lymph nodes. You had an ERCP, a procedure 
that evaluates your bile ducts. It showed that you had a 
blockage, and a stent was placed to drain your bile. After the 
stent was placed, your bilirubin (the chemical that makes your 
skin yellow) dramatically decreased. You also had an MRI 
performed, which showed a mass in the head of the pancreas, 
likely the cause of the obstruction. During the ERCP, samples of 
the cells in the bile ducts were taken to see if they are 
cancerous, and what type of cancer they might be (cytology). You 
will get a phone call about this within 10 days. If you do not 
hear from anyone in 10 days, please call me at ___.
 
Followup Instructions:
