**Chief Complaint:**
- Syncope

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:**
- Endoscopy with banding of esophageal varices

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient, a gentleman with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) versus intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, presented with syncope and coffee ground emesis. He has a history of massive disease progression on reduced dose sorafenib therapy. Initial evaluation revealed upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with a significant hematocrit drop from 35 to 16.7, and white blood cell count of 22. He received 2 units of blood and 4 liters of fluid, and was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. A CT scan showed advanced infiltrative HCC with right portal vein occlusion and increased ascites.

**Diagnostic Tests and Imaging:**
- **CT Abdomen/Pelvis:** Advanced infiltrative HCC, right portal vein occlusion, increased ascites, and diffuse hyperenhancement of the small bowel wall.
- **CXR:** Normal heart size, clear lungs, no free air.
- **KUB:** No obstruction, contrast in the colon.
- **EGD:** Grade II esophageal varices banded, mild portal hypertensive gastropathy.
- **CT Torso:** Massive infiltrative HCC involving the entire liver, ascites, no extra-hepatic spread.
- **Blood Culture:** Viridans streptococci isolated, treated with vancomycin initially, then clindamycin.

**Physical Exam:**
- **Vitals:** 99.0Â°F, 124/90 mmHg, 81 bpm, 16 breaths/min
- **General:** Thin, chronically ill appearance
- **HEENT:** Anicteric sclerae, clear oral cavity
- **Neck:** Supple, no lymphadenopathy
- **Cardiovascular:** Regular rhythm, no murmurs
- **Respiratory:** Clear to auscultation
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, moderately distended, ascites present
- **Extremities:** No edema
- **Neurologic:** Alert and oriented, normal cranial nerves, steady gait

**Pertinent Lab Results:**
- **Admission Hct:** 16.7
- **Discharge Hct:** 31.0
- **Liver Enzymes:** Elevated AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels
- **Blood Culture:** Viridans streptococci

**Hospital Course:**
- **UGIB:** Managed with blood transfusions, octreotide, PPI, and EGD with variceal banding. Stable hematocrit post-transfusion.
- **Infection:** Initial treatment with vancomycin, switched to clindamycin after blood culture results.
- **Metabolic Acidosis:** Resolved with blood products and IV fluids.
- **Hypercalcemia:** Managed with IV fluids and lasix, calcium normalized by discharge.
- **Liver Cancer:** No chemotherapy during hospitalization, recommended palliative care.

**Medications:**
- **Admission:** Megestrol, ondansetron, oxycodone, prochlorperazine, omeprazole
- **Discharge:** Sucralfate, docusate, pantoprazole, ciprofloxacin, lactulose, oxycodone, compazine, megestrol, ondansetron, clindamycin

**Discharge Disposition:**
- Home

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- Hepatocellular carcinoma vs intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with portal vein occlusion
- UGIB secondary to portal hypertension
- Anemia secondary to blood loss
- Hypercalcemia

**Discharge Condition:**
- Stable, no active bleeding, ambulating without assistance, tolerating diet and medications

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Follow up with primary care physician within a week, monitor for signs of bleeding, and take all prescribed medications.
