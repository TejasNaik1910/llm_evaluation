**Pertinent Results:**
- **Admission Labs:** Elevated TSH (98), low Free T4 (0.7), elevated CRP (3.7), and other routine blood tests.
- **Imaging:** CT abdomen with contrast showed endplate irregularity at L4/L5, severe scoliosis, and degenerative disc disease.
- **Microbiology:** Blood culture grew Viridans streptococci in one set; other cultures were negative.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- **Back Pain and L4/L5 Lesion:** CT scan revealed a lucency at L4/L5 suggestive of chronic discitis/osteomyelitis vs. severe degenerative joint disease (DJD). The patient underwent a spine biopsy, which showed no growth in cultures. Infectious Disease (ID) consultation recommended no antibiotics due to low suspicion of infection.
