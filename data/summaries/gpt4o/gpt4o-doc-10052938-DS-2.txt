**History of Present Illness:**
The patient, a female with a history of metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, presented for ERCP due to bile duct obstruction. She had a previous tumor resection with positive margins and liver metastases, requiring a hepaticoduodenostomy. An uncovered metal stent was placed earlier due to biliary obstruction. She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and elevated bilirubin (3.7), and blood cultures showed gram-negative rods. ERCP failed due to tumor growth through the stent. She was transferred for PTBD placement.

- **Discharge:** Alert, oriented, mild tachycardia, bibasilar crackles, soft abdomen, no acute distress.

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Admission Labs:** Elevated WBC, low Hgb, elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin 2.2.
- **Discharge Labs:** Improved WBC, Hgb, liver enzymes normalized, bilirubin 0.9.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
The patient presented with hypotension, fever, and chills, diagnosed with cholangitis and bacteremia (E. coli and Group D Strep) due to biliary obstruction. She underwent percutaneous biliary drain placement. Initial treatment included vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl, later transitioned to levofloxacin and flagyl. She required a brief ICU stay for hypotension management, which resolved with IV fluids. Imaging showed progression of metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. She was discharged with a plan for outpatient follow-up and possible palliative chemotherapy or hospice care.
