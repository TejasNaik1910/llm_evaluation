**Brief Hospital Course:**
- The patient was admitted for the resection of a right carotid body tumor. She underwent angioembolization of the tumor in the endovascular suite, which she tolerated well without complications. The subsequent resection preserved the internal and external carotid arteries and included facial nerve monitoring. Post-operatively, she had no groin swelling or neurological deficits. A right Jackson-Pratt (JP) drain was placed below the incision, initially draining sanguineous fluid, which became sero-sanguineous. By post-operative day (POD) 4, the drainage volume decreased to less than 30 mL/day, and the drain was removed. The patient tolerated a regular diet, ambulated without assistance, voided without issues, and managed pain with oral medications. She was deemed ready for discharge with appropriate instructions.
