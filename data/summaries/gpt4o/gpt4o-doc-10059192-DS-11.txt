She was transferred with abdominal pain and new abscesses. Previous attempts at abscess drainage were incomplete.

**Recent Hospital Course:**

- Treated with IV antibiotics (Zosyn, Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole) and supportive care including IV fluids and Ondansetron for nausea.

**Physical Exam:**
- Admission: Alert, oriented, somewhat confused, soft non-tender abdomen, normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings.
- Discharge: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings, no abdominal tenderness.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **Labs:** Notable for hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, mild metabolic encephalopathy, and anemia.
- **Imaging:** CT abdomen/pelvis showed multiple fluid collections, some with air-fluid levels. TTE showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. CXR and stress EKG were unremarkable.
- **Microbiology:** Blood cultures negative, urine culture positive for Staph aureus.

**Medications:**
- **Admission:** Atorvastatin, Cyanocobalamin, Fluoxetine, Vitamin D, Loperamide.
- **Discharge:** Added Aspirin, Calcium Carbonate, Cepacol, Methylphenidate, Metoprolol Succinate, Mirtazapine, Omeprazole. Adjusted Fluoxetine dosage.

**Hospital Course:**
- **Complicated Diverticulitis with Abscess:** Managed with antibiotics and supportive care. Surgery deferred due to the patient's overall condition and lack of systemic inflammatory symptoms.
- **Severe Malnutrition and Weight Loss:** Managed with nutritional support including tube feeding after PEG tube placement.
- **Depression and Apathy:** Treated with psychiatric medications including Methylphenidate, Fluoxetine, and Mirtazapine.
- **Acute on Chronic Diarrhea:** Managed with Loperamide and adjustments to tube feeding.
- **Staph Aureus UTI:** Treated with Ceftriaxone and transitioned to Bactrim based on sensitivities.
- **Anemia:** Monitored with no active bleeding identified.

**Discharge Condition:**
- Mental status clear and coherent, alert and interactive, ambulatory and independent.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Continue medications as prescribed.
- Follow up with primary care and specialists as scheduled.
- Monitor nutritional status and consider discontinuation of PEG if symptoms improve.

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- **Primary:** Complicated diverticulitis with abscess, weakness, poor appetite, depression, and apathy.
- **Secondary:** Chronic diarrhea, acute kidney injury, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, vitamin D deficiency.

**Follow-Up:**
- Ensure follow-up with psychiatry, colorectal surgery, and primary care for ongoing management and monitoring.
