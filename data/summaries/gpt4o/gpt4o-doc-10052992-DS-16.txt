**Chief Complaint:**
- Status post (s/p) Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE)

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:**
- **Procedure:** Transarterial chemoembolization
- **Findings:**
  1. Conventional celiac and hepatic arterial anatomy.
  2. Pre-embolization arteriogram and cone beam CT showing tumor blush in segment VI.
  3. Post-embolization showing staining of tumor in segment VI with inflow arterial stasis.
- **Impression:** Successful left greater artery approach trans-arterial chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) located in segment VI.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient is a male with colon cancer (T3 N1 M0) status post resection and FOLFOX chemotherapy, HCV/HBV cirrhosis (compensated) with hepatocellular carcinoma, status post multiple radiofrequency ablations (RFA), admitted for TACE for a 2.2-cm segment VI HCC recurrence. The patient tolerated the procedure well but experienced wheezing post-procedure, which improved with nebulization.

**Past Medical History:**
- **Oncologic History:**
  - Hepatocellular carcinoma in the setting of HCV, HBV, and possible alcoholic cirrhosis.
  - Multiple interventions including resection, RFA, and TACE for recurrent HCC.
  - Colon cancer (T3 N1 M0) treated with resection and FOLFOX chemotherapy.
  - History of esophageal varices, gastric ulcer, and portal hypertension.
  - Multiple imaging studies (MR liver, CT torso) showing various stages of HCC and other liver lesions.
  - PET scan recommended for further evaluation.
  - History of portal vein thrombosis.
