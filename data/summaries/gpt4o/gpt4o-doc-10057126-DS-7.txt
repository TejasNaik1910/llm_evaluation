- **Discharge Date:** [Redacted]
- **Date of Birth:** [Redacted]
- **Sex:** Male
- **Service:** Medicine
- **Attending:** [Redacted]
- **Allergies:** No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

**Chief Complaint:**
- Chest pain

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:**
- Status post (s/p) Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, well-controlled multiple myeloma, and obesity. He experienced intermittent exertional chest pain and shortness of breath over several months, which resolved with rest. An abnormal stress test led to his admission for a cardiac catheterization, revealing unchanged CAD. His symptoms were attributed to severe aortic stenosis, and he was deemed an intermediate surgical risk for aortic valve replacement. He was admitted for TAVR.

**NYHA Class:**
- III

**Past Medical History:**
1. Severe aortic stenosis
2. Multiple myeloma (well-controlled)
3. Hypertension
4. Obesity
5. Coronary artery disease (BMS to LAD)
6. Neuropathy

  - Triglycerides: 250*, HDL: 42, LDLcalc: 23
- **Imaging:**
  - **TTE:**
    - Pre-TAVR: Severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area ≤1.0 cm²), mild aortic regurgitation
    - Post-TAVR: Well-seated prosthesis with normal leaflet motion, trace aortic regurgitation
  - **CT Head W/O Contrast:**
    - No evidence of recent infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or mass
  - **MRI Brain:**
    - Multiple scattered acute to subacute infarcts, likely cardioembolic
  - **MRA Brain/Neck:**
    - Mild atheromatous narrowing, no significant stenosis or occlusion

**Procedure:**
- **TAVR:**
  - Pre-procedure AV mean gradient: 47mmHg
  - Post-procedure: Normal leaflet motion, trace aortic regurgitation, no significant complications

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- **Assessment/Plan:**
  - Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, s/p TAVR complicated by small punctate scattered acute embolic stroke
  - Transient memory deficit post-op, resolved
  - Continue daily aspirin and Plavix, high-dose statin
  - Follow-up echo and SH appointment in 1 month

**Chronic Issues:**
- Leukopenia (likely due to multiple myeloma treatment)
- Multiple myeloma (on Revlimid)
- HSV/VZV suppression (on acyclovir)
- Depression (on paroxetine)
- Neuropathy (on gabapentin)
- Obstructive sleep apnea (uses CPAP)
