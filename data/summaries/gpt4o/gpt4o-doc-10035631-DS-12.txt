- **Discharge Labs:** ALT (101), AST (43), ALK PHOS (264)
- **Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):** No microorganisms or fungal elements seen
- **Chest X-ray and CT:** Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, likely cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or multifocal infection

**Brief Hospital Course:**
1. **Shortness of Breath:** Presented with dyspnea and CT findings of diffuse bilateral opacities. Differential diagnosis included aspergillosis and organizing pneumonia. Discontinued voriconazole three weeks prior due to transaminitis. Remained afebrile with 94% oxygen saturation. Underwent bronchoscopy; pending biopsy results. Discharged on voriconazole 450 mg q12hrs for 1 day, then 350 mg q12hrs.
2. **Transaminitis:** Elevated liver enzymes of uncertain etiology. Hepatology consult recommended abdominal ultrasound (normal liver, gallbladder, spleen). Labs for iron studies, hepatitis, and rheumatologic markers ordered. Liver enzymes downtrended without intervention.
3. **Male Breast Cancer:** Post-mastectomy, planned for tamoxifen, not started due to transaminitis.
4. **AML post-alloBMT (day+261):** Continued tacrolimus and acyclovir prophylaxis.

**Medications on Admission:**
1. Acyclovir 400 mg PO Q8H
2. Folic Acid 1 mg PO DAILY
