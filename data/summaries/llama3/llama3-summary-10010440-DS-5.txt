Here is a summary of the clinical note:

**Cancer Diagnosis:** Multiple myeloma, with a lesion in the T12 vertebral body and destruction of the thecal sac.

**Morphology:** Plasma cell dyscrasia, consistent with multiple myeloma.

**TNM Staging:** Not specified.

**Progression:** The patient had a history of multiple myeloma, but it was not conclusive until now. The patient had a 2.5-month history of progressive weakness and recurrent falls, as well as a 30-pound weight loss.

**Prescribed Medications:**

* Dexamethasone 4mg IV Q24H (may switch to PO once radiation therapy starts)
* Fentanyl patch 50mcg/hour TD Q72H
* OxycoDONE (Immediate Release) 10mg PO Q4H
* Heparin 5000 UNIT SC TID
* Insulin SC sliding scale
* Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
* Sulfameth/Trimethoprim DS 1 TAB PO BID (duration: 2 days)

**Diagnostic Tests:**

* CT spine
* MRI spine
* CT head
* Pathology report from surgical resection
* Blood tests (WBC, RBC, Hgb, Hct, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, Plt)
* Urine culture (ESCHERICHIA COLI)

**Surgical Interventions:**

* Anterior arthrodesis T11-L1
* Application interbody cage T11-L1
* Biopsy of T12 vertebral body
* Posterior arthrodesis T10-L2
* Posterolateral posterior instrumentation T10-L2 segmental
* Open treatment fracture dislocation from metastatic disease and destruction of the T12 vertebral body
* Laminectomy of partial L1, all of T12, and the inferior aspect of T11
* Application of allograft
