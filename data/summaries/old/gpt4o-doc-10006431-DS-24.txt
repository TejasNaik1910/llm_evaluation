**Chief Complaint:**
- Abdominal pain

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:**
- **Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS):** Celiac Plexus Neurolysis performed using a linear echoendoscope. Bupivacaine and dehydrated alcohol were injected to manage pain.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient, a [Redacted]-year-old woman with metastatic pancreatic cancer, was admitted due to progressive epigastric abdominal pain over one week. She is deaf and uses ASL, with her son assisting in communication.
- Symptoms included nausea, dry heaves, poor oral intake, and emesis. Initial treatment included olanzapine for nausea, which caused drowsiness.
- Diagnostic tests in the ED revealed elevated lipase (2800), and a CT scan showed a large infiltrative pancreatic head tumor with associated pancreatitis and liver metastases.

**Past Medical History:**
- **Oncologic History:** Diagnosed with borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) with a pancreatic head mass. Initial treatment included neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX, followed by mFOLFOX. Surgery was aborted due to liver metastases, and palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine was initiated.
- **Other Conditions:** Hypertension, congenital deafness, GERD, goiter, nephrolithiasis, hypercholesterolemia, status post C-section x2.

**Social and Family History:**
- Family history includes father with MI, mother with type 2 diabetes, and sisters with colon cancer and another unspecified disease. The patient has two healthy sons.

**Physical Exam:**
- **Vitals:** T 97.9, BP 108/66, HR 70, RR 18, O2 95% RA.

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Labs:** Elevated WBC (12.0), low RBC (3.41), low Hgb (9.6), low Hct (30.0), low albumin (2.7), elevated lipase (293).
- **Imaging:** CT abdomen showed a large infiltrative pancreatic head tumor, tumor infiltrate/pancreatitis, portal vein and splenic vein attenuation, multiple liver metastases, and significant stool in the right colon.

**Assessment and Plan:**
- **Pancreatitis:** Likely due to tumor-related inflammation. Managed with a low-fat diet, palliative care consultation, and pain management with oxycontin.
- **Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer:** Initially treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and planned Whipple procedure, which was aborted due to liver metastases. Currently on palliative gemcitabine, with plans to initiate nab-paclitaxel postponed until the patient regains strength.
- **Hypertension:** Managed by discontinuing ACE inhibitors due to hypotension.
- **GERD:** Continued on PPI.

**Medications on Admission:**
- Lisinopril, olanzapine, omeprazole, ondansetron, oxycodone, prochlorperazine, tramadol, acetaminophen.
