- **Metastasis:** Progression to liver confirmed by PET CT and biopsy.
- **Surgical Interventions:** Laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and IUD removal (benign pathology).

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Labs:** Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, LDH, AlkPhos), high bilirubin levels, anemia (low Hgb, Hct), hyperkalemia.
- **Microbiology:** No microorganisms seen in gram stain; fluid culture pending.
- **Imaging:** RUQ ultrasound showed extensive hepatic metastatic disease, moderate ascites, patent intrahepatic portal venous system, normal biliary system.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- **Ascites:** Likely due to liver infiltration by metastatic disease. Admitted for paracentesis; previous paracentesis earlier this month was negative for malignancy. Future need for regular paracentesis or peritoneal catheter placement discussed.
- **Abdominal Pain:** Attributed to worsening metastatic disease and ascites. No evidence of portal vein thrombosis or biliary obstruction.
