- Left percutaneous nephrostomy tube exchange.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient is a male with advanced prostate cancer metastatic to the liver and peritoneal carcinomatosis. He was recently admitted for left PCN tube placement and presented with an obstructed left PCN tube. He reported decreased urine output from the nephrostomy tube, which led to his admission.

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Admission Labs:** Elevated WBC (21.1), creatinine (3.1), and BUN (38). Urinalysis showed large leukocytes and blood, few bacteria.
- **Imaging:** Left antegrade nephrostogram showed poor flow through the tube, moderate to severe hydronephrosis, successful nephrostomy tube exchange.
- **Discharge Labs:** Improved creatinine (1.7), stable WBC (9.7), and other parameters.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- **Left Hydronephrosis and Flank Pain:** Managed with successful nephrostomy tube exchange, resulting in clear yellow urine drainage.
- **Acute Kidney Injury:** Likely post-renal due to PCN obstruction, improved with tube replacement and IV fluids.
- **Pyuria and Leukocytosis:** Initially treated with antibiotics (zosyn and ceftriaxone), but urine culture showed no growth, and antibiotics were discontinued.
- **Malignant Ascites:** Managed with paracentesis, removing 3.5L of fluid.
