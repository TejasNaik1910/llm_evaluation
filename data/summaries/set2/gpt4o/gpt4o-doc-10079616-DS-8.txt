**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient has advanced prostate cancer metastatic to the liver with peritoneal carcinomatosis.

- **Admission Exam:** Vital signs stable, no acute distress, clear lungs, soft abdomen with palpable subcutaneous nodules, clear fluid leaking from left posterior thorax.
- **Discharge Exam:** Cachectic male, stable vital signs, diminished breath sounds at right base, no abdominal masses, mild tenderness at PCN site, no evidence of leaking.

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Admission Labs:** Elevated PSA (2371), anemia (HGB 8.4), elevated liver enzymes (AST 75, ALK PHOS 428).
- **Microbiology:** Peritoneal fluid positive for malignant cells, no growth in cultures.
- **Imaging:** Bilateral obstructing renal stones, moderate ascites, multiple liver masses.
- **Procedures:** Successful paracentesis (3.5L fluid removed), nephrostomy tube placement, and tract embolization.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- **Advanced Prostate Cancer:** Metastatic to liver and peritoneum. Terminal condition with poor prognosis. Received cabazitaxel chemotherapy.
- **Leaking PCN Site:** Previous PCN tract embolized, new PCN tube placed. Significant pain managed with oxycontin.
- **Malignant Ascites:** Managed with paracentesis and symptomatic treatment for nausea/vomiting.
- **Anemia:** Normocytic, likely due to chronic inflammation. Managed with blood transfusion.
- **DVT:** Continued on aspirin due to gastrointestinal bleeding risk.

**Discharge Disposition:**
- Home with service

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- **Primary Diagnoses:** Malignant ascites secondary to metastatic prostate cancer, malignant ureteral obstruction causing bilateral hydroureter and hydronephrosis.
- **Secondary Diagnoses:** Anemia, deep vein thrombosis, metastatic prostate cancer, hypertension.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Follow-up for blood work to check kidney function.
- Visit clinic for Neulasta patch placement.
- Continue pain management with oxycontin and oxycodone.
