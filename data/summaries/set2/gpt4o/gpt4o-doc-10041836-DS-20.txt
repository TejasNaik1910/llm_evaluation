Despite using a walker, she continues to experience severe pain, especially with walking or sitting. She also reports a needle sensation in the LLE and low back pain, along with fatigue and unsteadiness. She denies fevers and chills but endorses dizziness and nausea without vomiting. In the ED, she was found to have an INR of 11.7 and was treated with vitamin K and potassium. She was also diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and treated with Bactrim.
