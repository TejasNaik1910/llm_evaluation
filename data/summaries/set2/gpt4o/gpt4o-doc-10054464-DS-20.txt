**Chief Complaint:**
- Shortness of breath (SOB)

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:**
- Thoracentesis with 500cc fluid removed

**Oncologic History:**
- **Cancer Type:** Poorly differentiated squamous lung cancer
- **Morphology:** Poorly differentiated, necrotic lung mass in the left lower lobe (LLL)
- **Metastasis:** Adrenals, brain, and soft tissue (jaw & back)
- **Initial Presentation:** Jaw pain, back mass, night sweats, weight loss
- **Pathology:** Tumor cells positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and cytokeratin 7; negative for cytokeratin 20, TTF-1, HMB-45, MART1, and S100 protein, confirming carcinoma and excluding malignant melanoma.

**History of Present Illness:**
- Patient with poorly differentiated squamous lung cancer on carboplatin/taxol, post-thoracentesis, now receiving radiation therapy (XRT) to the left lung. Presented with subjective SOB but not requiring more oxygen than at home.
- **Emergency Department (ED) Findings:** 
  - Vitals: T98.8, HR86, BP109/61, RR20, O2 99%
  - CXR: Unchanged (known lung cancer and small pleural effusion)
  - EKG: Changes consistent with ischemia (ST decreased in V2-V6), thought to be demand ischemia. Cardiology advised no safe intervention.
  - Treatment: Received 1L normal saline (NS) and aspirin (ASA).

**Past Medical History:**
- Hypertension (HTN)
- Hyperlipidemia
- Coronary artery disease (CAD) with myocardial infarction (MI) [years ago]
- Status post (s/p) tonsillectomy

**Social History:**
- [Redacted]

**Family History:**
- Sister had breast cancer. No known family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death.

**Physical Exam:**
- Vitals: 98.0, BP 85/56, HR 82, RR 23, O2 97% on room air
- Eyes: EOMI, PERRL, conjunctiva clear
- Neck: No JVD, no LAD, no thyromegaly, no carotid bruits
- Cardiovascular: RRR, normal S1/S2, no murmurs/rubs/gallops
- Respiratory: RLL basilar crackles, decreased breath sounds in the entire left lung; large upper back mass covered in dressing
- Gastrointestinal: Soft, non-tender/non-distended, no hepatosplenomegaly, normal bowel sounds
- Extremities: No clubbing, no cyanosis, 1+ pitting edema in ankles (L>R), chronic skin scaling lesion non-infected over R ankle
- Psychiatric: Appropriate, pleasant
- Hematological/Lymphatic: No palpable lymphadenopathy

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Urine Analysis:** Positive for blood, nitrite, protein; many bacteria
- **Blood Tests:** Elevated glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, anion gap; low hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC; high WBC, platelets
- **Imaging:** CXR showed persistent left lower lung opacity, small right pleural effusion, improved left upper lung aeration

**Brief Hospital Course:**
1. **CAD:** Recent NSTEMI, EKG changes without significantly elevated troponins. No safe intervention possible.
2. **SOB:** No evidence of pneumonia or worsening effusion, possibly due to disease progression.
3. **UTI:** Treated with Ciprofloxacin.
4. **Anemia:** Normocytic, stable, likely due to chronic disease from malignancy.
5. **Oncologic:** Continued carboplatin/taxol treatment. Follow-up with chemotherapy scheduled.
6. **Pain:** Controlled with home medication regimen.
7. **Depression:** Continued home medications.

**Medications on Admission:**
- Simvastatin, Atenolol, Latanoprost, Acetaminophen, Colace, Senna, Bisacodyl, Hydromorphone, Simethicone, Prochlorperazine, Lorazepam, Ranitidine, Fentanyl patch

**Discharge Medications:**
- Senna, Simvastatin, Latanoprost, Acetaminophen, Ranitidine, Ciprofloxacin, Docusate Sodium, Bisacodyl, Prochlorperazine, Megestrol, Lidocaine patch, Mirtazapine, Omeprazole, Sotalol, Aspirin

**Discharge Disposition:**
- Home with service

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- **Primary:** Urinary tract infection, Dyspnea (NOS), Squamous cell carcinoma
- **Secondary:** Coronary artery disease, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia

**Discharge Condition:**
- Stable, saturating 100% on 3L oxygen, not in pain

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Continue home oxygen if short of breath, take prescribed antibiotics, and continue regular medications. Return to the emergency department if experiencing worsening symptoms.
