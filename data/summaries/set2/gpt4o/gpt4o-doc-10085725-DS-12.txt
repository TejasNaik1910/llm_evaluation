**Chief Complaint:**
- Right-sided recurrent malignant pleural effusion

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:**
- Pleurex catheter placement

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient has a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is on cycle 4 of Keytruda. She has recurrent left-sided pleural effusion, having undergone approximately four thoracenteses in the past three months. She presented with dyspnea worsened by exertion for six days. Imaging showed worsening left-sided pleural effusions and severe left lung atelectasis. She was transferred for evaluation and placement of a pleurex catheter.

**Past Medical History:**
- Type II Diabetes Mellitus (managed with diet)
- History of Myocardial Infarction (medically managed with metoprolol, aspirin, and losartan)

**Social History:**

**Family History:**
- Non-contributory

**Physical Exam:**
- **Admission:**
  - Vitals: T 98.0, BP 96/57, HR 80, RR 21, O2sat 98%
  - General: Alert, oriented, well-appearing
  - HEENT: MMM, oropharynx clear, PEERL
  - Neck: Supple, no JVD
  - Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1/S2
  - Lungs: Decreased sounds on the left, wheezes throughout
  - Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, normoactive bowel sounds
  - Extremities: No edema, well-perfused, 2+ pulses
  - Neurologic: CN II-VII intact, no focal deficits
  - Skin: Warm, dry, intact

- **Discharge:**
  - Vitals: T 97.7, BP 119/72, P 81, RR 18, O2sat 93% on RA
  - General: Alert, mild distress due to pain
  - HEENT: MMM, EOMI
  - Neck: No JVD, no LAD
  - Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs/rubs/gallops
  - Lungs: Diminished breath sounds at the left lung base
  - Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended
  - Extremities: Warm, well-perfused, no edema
  - Neurologic: Grossly normal

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Admission Labs:**
  - Na+ 129, BUN 11, Cr 0.7, Osm 272
  - WBC 8.2, Hgb 9.7, Plt 277
  - Imaging: CT showed moderate-sized partly loculated left pleural effusion, severe left lung atelectasis, mild mediastinal and left hilar adenopathy, stable right lung nodules, and severe emphysema.

- **Discharge Labs:**
  - Na+ 128, BUN 11, Cr 0.8, Hgb 9.6

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- The patient with metastatic NSCLC and recurrent left-sided effusions underwent pleurex catheter placement due to quick reaccumulation of effusion post-thoracentesis. She initially required nasal cannula oxygen but was weaned to room air with O2 saturations > 92%. She received duonebs and Tylenol/tramadol for pain control. Chronic hyponatremia likely due to SIADH secondary to metastatic lung carcinoma was managed, with Na at discharge being 128.

**Medications:**
- **Admission:**
  - Losartan Potassium, Folic Acid, Atorvastatin, Metoprolol Succinate XL, Amlodipine, Aspirin, Magnesium Oxide

- **Discharge:**
  - Aspirin, Atorvastatin, Folic Acid, Losartan Potassium, Magnesium Oxide, Metoprolol Succinate XL

**Discharge Disposition:**
- Home with service

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- **Primary:** Left-sided pleural effusion, Hyponatremia
- **Secondary:** Anemia, Metastatic lung cancer

**Discharge Condition:**
- Mental Status: Clear and coherent
- Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive
- Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Follow-up with PCP and oncologist. Instructions for pleurex catheter care were provided.
