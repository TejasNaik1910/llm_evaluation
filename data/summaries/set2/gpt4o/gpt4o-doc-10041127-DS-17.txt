**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient has a history of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the liver with extensive right upper quadrant (RUQ) disease. He has been off chemotherapy since [date redacted] and presented with abdominal pain and distention. Recent lab results showed a significant increase in bilirubin levels (7.9 from a baseline of 3). The patient reported intermittent fevers, no bowel movements for two days, difficulty holding objects, and a fall in the past week. A CT scan revealed no ductal dilation or small bowel obstruction but showed an increase in abdominal/pelvic free fluid and diffuse hepatic metastases.

**Past Medical History:**
- **Oncologic History:**
  - Initial symptoms included early satiety and bloating.
  - Liver ultrasound revealed a large mass in the right lobe extending into the left lobe.
  - Biopsy confirmed neuroendocrine carcinoma positive for CK7, CK20, chromogranins, synaptophysin, and S-100.
  - CT scans showed the mass causing biliary obstruction and involvement of the portal vein.
  - AFP levels were over 3000.
  - Exploratory laparotomy and nodule biopsy indicated the carcinoma was unresectable.
  - Chemotherapy included cycles of cisplatin/gemcitabine, which were eventually stopped due to myelosuppression.
  - Sorafenib was started but later stopped due to fatigue and weight loss.
