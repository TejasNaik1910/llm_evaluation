**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient is an elderly female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin and nonresectable cholangiocarcinoma. She was transferred due to abdominal pain, jaundice, elevated bilirubin/alkaline phosphatase, and CT showing stent occlusion. She received zosyn and oral vitamin K prior to transfer.

**Past Medical History:**
- Hypertension (HTN)
- Atrial fibrillation (Afib) status post pacemaker placement on coumadin
- Mitral valve prolapse (MVP)
- Osteoarthritis (OA) of the right hip
- Cholangiocarcinoma (s/p metal stent, XRT, and chemo, PTBD)

**Family History:**
- Mother with colon cancer, sister with multiple myeloma, niece with lung cancer, father with coronary artery disease, maternal grandfather with stomach cancer

**Physical Exam:**
- Admission: Jaundice, scleral icterus, epigastric tenderness, irregular heart rhythm
- Discharge: Pain level 6, jaundice, scleral icterus, mild abdominal distension, epigastric tenderness, 2+ edema to waist

**Pertinent Results:**
- Blood tests showed elevated WBC, low RBC, Hgb, Hct, elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, AlkPhos), and total bilirubin.
- Renal ultrasound indicated slightly echogenic kidneys, suspected tiny calculus, and perihepatic and pelvic free fluid.
- ERCP findings included tumor burden at the distal opening of stents, successful biliary cannulation, and extraction of sludge and stone debris.
- PTBD: Successful replacement of a partially dislodged biliary drain and balloon plasty of the left metallic biliary stent.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- The patient underwent multiple ERCPs and interventional radiology procedures without improvement in labs or symptoms. After discussions, the patient was transitioned to comfort measures and discharged with hospice care.

**Discharge Medications:**
1. Digoxin 0.125 mg PO daily
2. Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID
3. Oxycodone 5 mg PO Q6H PRN pain
4. Senna 1 TAB PO BID PRN constipation
5. Ondansetron 4 mg PO Q8H PRN nausea

9. Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily
10. Simethicone 40-80 mg PO QID PRN gas pain
11. Ranitidine 150 mg PO BID

**Discharge Disposition:**
- Home with hospice services

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- Bile duct obstruction
- Cholangiocarcinoma
- Acute renal failure
- Atrial fibrillation

**Discharge Condition:**
- Mental Status: Clear and coherent
- Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive
- Activity Status: Ambulatory with assistance (walker or cane)

**Discharge Instructions:**
- The patient was admitted due to elevated liver enzymes likely related to cancer progression. Multiple attempts to fix blockages were unsuccessful. A family meeting led to the decision to focus on comfort and quality of life. Hospice care will manage needs at home. Warfarin was stopped, and a pain medication regimen was initiated.
