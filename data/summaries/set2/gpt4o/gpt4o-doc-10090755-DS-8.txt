**Chief Complaint:**
- Fever

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedures:**
- Pleural drain placement
- IP bedside chest tube placement
- VATs/Decortication/Pulmonary Nodule Biopsy
- Bronchoscopy

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient, a male with a history of hepatitis B (on tenofovir) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), presented with subjective fevers, shortness of breath, and tachycardia. He had a right hepatic lobectomy previously, revealing a tumor infiltrating the diaphragmatic muscle. He was admitted with a right-sided pleural effusion and negative cytology. During a prior admission, he had a large right pleural effusion drained, revealing lymphocytic exudative effusion and pleural nodules suggestive of metastases. AFP levels increased from 19 to 31. A staging CT showed pleural nodules and a supra-hepatic IVC thrombus, leading to enoxaparin initiation.

**Physical Examination:**
- **Admission:** T 99.0, BP 142/87, HR 108, RR 20, O2 sat 98% on 2L NC
- **Discharge:** T 97.9, BP 138/83, HR 84, RR 18, O2 sat 98% on RA

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **CXR:** Substantial residual right pleural effusion, loculated with gas collections, and severe right basal atelectasis.
- **CT Chest:** Complex right pleural effusion with gas locules, suggestive of hemothorax and blood clot. Stable small pulmonary nodules.
- **Pathology:** Pleural fluid negative for malignant cells. Pleura biopsy confirmed metastatic HCC.

**Medications:**
- **Admission:** Finasteride, Tamsulosin, Tenofovir, Oxycodone, Polyethylene Glycol, Acetaminophen, Enoxaparin
- **Discharge:** Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid, Mirtazapine, Multivitamins, Acetaminophen, Enoxaparin, Finasteride, Oxycodone, Polyethylene Glycol, Tamsulosin, Tenofovir

**Hospital Course:**
The patient was admitted with sepsis and empyema, requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics and pleural drainage. Despite interventions, he had minimal clinical improvement and ongoing fevers. Surgical management included RLL VATS/decortication/pulmonary nodule biopsy, revealing metastatic HCC. Post-surgery, he was maintained on vancomycin and zosyn, later switched to augmentin for a suspected RLL parenchymal abscess. Hemoptysis and bleeding complications were managed with bronchoscopy and reinitiation of anticoagulation therapy. The patientâ€™s creatinine levels improved after adjusting medications.

**Discharge Condition:**
- Mental Status: Clear and coherent
- Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive
- Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Continue prescribed medications and follow up with outpatient providers.
- Seek immediate medical attention if experiencing fevers, lethargy, or shortness of breath.

**Follow-up:**
- Close follow-up with interventional pulmonology and oncology for monitoring and treatment planning.
- Outpatient BMP to monitor kidney function.
- CT scan within weeks to monitor abscess.

**Discharge Diagnoses:**
- Primary: Metastatic HCC, IVC thrombus, Pulmonary abscess, Empyema, Malignant pleural effusion, Hemoptysis
- Secondary: Hepatitis B, Elevated fasting glucose
