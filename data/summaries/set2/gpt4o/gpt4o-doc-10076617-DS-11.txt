**Chief Complaint:**
- Fever, nausea, and vomiting.

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedures:**
- CT-guided drainage of pelvic abscess with drain placement.
- PICC line placement.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient is a [Redacted] G0 with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), Sweet's disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and diverticulitis status post (s/p) colectomy. She is also status post (s/p) uncomplicated total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), and cystoscopy for endometrial cancer. Her post-operative course was complicated by wound separation requiring a wound vac placement on post-operative day (POD) 2. She was started on a 7-day course of Keflex for superficial cellulitis of her left hand and discharged on POD6 to a rehabilitation facility for wound care.

**Current Presentation:**
- The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with nausea, vomiting, and fever up to 102.6°F. A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis showed a 5.6 cm fluid collection in the left lower quadrant (LLQ), consistent with a post-op seroma vs. lymphocele with possible abscess features. Blood and urine cultures were drawn.

**Past Medical History:**
- Endometrial cancer s/p ex lap/TAH/BSO/LND.
- T2DM, pulmonary hypertension, OSA, Sweet's disease, anemia, diverticulitis s/p partial colectomy, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), urge incontinence, sciatica, possible myelodysplastic syndrome, anxiety, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, morbid obesity.

**Physical Exam:**
- On admission: Vital signs stable, no acute distress, clear lungs, soft abdomen with mild tenderness, well-managed wound with no signs of infection.
- On discharge: Vitals within normal limits, minimal abdominal discomfort, improved wound condition with granulation tissue and no significant drainage.

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Admission Labs:** Elevated WBC (18.5), low hemoglobin (8.8), and hematocrit (28.0).
- **Microbiology:** Blood cultures grew Bacteroides fragilis; abscess cultures showed polymicrobial growth including Enterococcus species and Escherichia coli.
- **Radiology:** CT Abd/Pelvis showed a 5.6 cm fluid collection in the left mid-pelvis, likely a postoperative seroma vs. lymphocele with possible superinfection.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- The patient was re-admitted with fever, nausea, and vomiting due to an intra-abdominal collection suspected to be an infected lymphocyst. She was started on IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, later switched to IV piperacillin-tazobactam based on culture sensitivities. A CT-guided drainage was performed, and a PICC line was placed for prolonged IV antibiotic therapy. The patient’s condition improved, and she was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

**Medications on Admission:**
- Atorvastatin, colchicine, dapsone, pioglitazone, sertraline, solifenacin, aspirin, calcium carbonate, ibuprofen, multivitamin.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Atorvastatin, dapsone, ibuprofen, glargine, insulin sliding scale, loperamide, oxycodone, piperacillin-tazobactam, sertraline, sodium chloride flush, solifenacin, acetaminophen, glipizide, glucagon, colchicine, aspirin.

**Discharge Disposition:**
- Extended care facility.

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- Intra-abdominal abscess, bacteremia, diabetes.

**Discharge Condition:**
- Mental status: Clear and coherent.
- Level of consciousness: Alert and interactive.
- Activity status: Ambulatory with assistance.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Follow medication regimen, avoid strenuous activity, and maintain wound care. Continue insulin therapy for diabetes management and follow up with primary care and diabetes specialists.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
- Weekly lab tests and follow-up appointments with infectious disease and diabetes specialists.
