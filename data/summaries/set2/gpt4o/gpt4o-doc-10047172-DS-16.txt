**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient is a male with a history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver, presenting with melena. He noticed black stool in the morning, which he had experienced once before after an ERCP.

**Oncologic History:**
- **Diagnosis:** Pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver, diagnosed in [Redacted].
- **Morphology:** 3.3 cm pancreatic head mass, 1.8 cm left kidney lesion (RCC), and sub-cm liver masses.
- **Cancer Stage:** Stage 4
- **Progression:** Initially treated with FOLFIRINOX, halted due to rising CA levels and increased liver metastases. Switched to gemcitabine/Abraxane with slight decrease in liver metastases. Later switched to CapOx and then modified FOLFIRINOX due to mixed response and side effects. Recent CT showed disease progression.
- **TNM Staging:** Not explicitly mentioned.
- **Prescribed Medications:** FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine/Abraxane, CapOx, modified FOLFIRINOX, erlotinib, gemcitabine.
- **Diagnostic Tests:** CT, MRI, FNA of pancreas, RUQ US, EGD.
- **Surgical Interventions:** CBD stent placement, PICC line placement.
- **Response to Treatment:** Mixed response to chemotherapy, with progression noted on recent CT scans.
