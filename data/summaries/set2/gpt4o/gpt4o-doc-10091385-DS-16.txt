- The patient presented with a new liver mass and omental implants identified on a CT scan.

The pain varied in nature (sharp, dull, stinging, crampy) and was relieved by the fetal position but worsened with abrupt movements. No changes in bowel or bladder habits, no blood in stool, and no changes in appetite were noted. An initial abdominal ultrasound at an outside hospital (OSH) was negative. A subsequent CT scan revealed a 6.2cm x 4cm liver mass and omental implants, the largest being 6.2 x 2.7cm in the left pelvis.
