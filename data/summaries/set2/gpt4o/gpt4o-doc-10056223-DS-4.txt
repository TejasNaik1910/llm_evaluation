**Chief Complaint:**
- Hypotension and lethargy following radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedures:**
- Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
- Chest tube placement
- Diagnostic paracentesis

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient is a [Redacted] year old man with a history of alcohol (EtOH) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis, complicated by ascites and prior variceal bleeds. Recent MRI showed two lesions suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He was admitted post-RFA with lethargy and hypotension. Post-procedure, he was given Dilaudid, Phenergan, Zofran, and Toradol. Despite plans to discharge him with Percocet, he remained lethargic and hypotensive, responsive to IV fluid boluses. Hematocrit levels dropped slightly post-procedure.

**Past Medical History:**
- HCV, genotype I
- EtOH and HCV cirrhosis
- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
- Hypertension (HTN)
- Past syphilis infection, treated, negative RPR

**Social History:**
- [Redacted]

**Family History:**
- No family history of liver disease or colon cancer. Mother has arthritis, father had diabetes, and sister has diabetes.

**Physical Exam:**
- **Admission:** Drowsy but conversant, no distress, distended abdomen with minimal tenderness, no significant edema, and stable vital signs.
- **Discharge:** Alert, conversant, ambulating independently, distended abdomen with ascites, tender in the right upper quadrant (RUQ).

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Admission Labs:** Mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and bilirubin.
- **Pertinent Studies:**
  - Liver biopsy confirmed well-to-moderately differentiated HCC with cirrhosis.
  - CT abdomen showed a large right-sided hemothorax and expected ablation zone appearance.
  - CXR showed large right pleural effusion, improved with chest tube placement.
- **Discharge Labs:** Improved liver enzymes, stable hematocrit, and no signs of infection in cultures.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- **Acute Care:**
  - **Hemothorax:** Managed with chest tube placement, draining 2 liters of bloody fluid, with no recurrence on discharge.
  - **Post-RFA:** Initially hypotensive and dizzy, managed with PCA and later transitioned to oral oxycodone. Nadolol was re-started.
  - **Intermittent Fevers:** Likely due to post-procedure inflammation and atelectasis, with no signs of infection in cultures.
- **Chronic Care:**
  - Compensated cirrhosis managed with nadolol for variceal bleed prophylaxis.
  - HCC: Post-op course involved hemothorax and fevers. Chemo-embolization required for a second HCC focus.

**Medications on Admission:**
- Nadolol 20mg PO daily
- Omeprazole 40mg PO daily
- Ferrous sulfate 325mg PO daily
