**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient, a male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity, presented with shortness of breath and chest pain. Diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function, dilated left atrium, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Cardiac catheterization revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease. Transferred for CABG evaluation and surgery was recommended.

- Carpal Tunnel Release, bilateral
- Cataracts, bilateral

**Family History:**
- No known history of premature coronary artery disease
- Mother and father died healthy at unspecified ages

- Height: 71 in, Weight: 281 lbs
- General: Obese male, no acute distress
- Lungs: Clear bilaterally
- Heart: Regular rate and rhythm

- Extremities: Warm, well-perfused, no edema
- Neuro: Grossly intact

**Discharge Examination:**
- Stable vitals, no focal neurological deficits, diminished respiratory sounds at bases, trace edema in extremities, stable sternal incision

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Labs:** Elevated glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and troponin levels; mild anemia
- **CXR:** Low lung volumes with subsegmental atelectasis, no pneumothorax or new consolidations
- **PFT:** Moderate gas exchange defect, mild restrictive ventilatory defect
- **LV Mass Pathology:** Partially organized fibrinous nodule, no malignancy

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- Transferred for significant coronary artery disease, underwent CABG x4 and removal of intracardiac tumor. Postoperative management included sedation weaning, extubation, diuresis with Lasix, beta-blockers, and management of delirium with precede drip and Haldol. Developed acute kidney injury, managed with adjusted diuretics. Transitioned to the floor on postoperative day six, clinically stable for discharge to acute rehab on postoperative day nine.
