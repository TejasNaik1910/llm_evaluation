Here is a summary of the clinical note in 500 words or less:

**Patient Information:**

* The patient is a ___ year old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, dyslipidemia, and poorly differentiated metastatic squamous cell lung cancer.
* He has metastases to the adrenals, brain, and soft tissue.

**Chief Complaint:**

* The patient presented with chest pain and diaphoresis, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation (A-fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotensive.

**Medical History:**

* The patient has a history of CAD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lung cancer.
* He had a myocardial infarction (MI) ___ years ago and has not been taking aspirin.
* He has undergone thoracentesis and has been receiving carboplatin and taxol chemotherapy for his lung cancer.

**Hospital Course:**

* The patient was cardioverted and transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit (CCU) for further care.
* He was found to have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was started on a high-dose statin.
* He was also seen by an electrophysiologist and started on sotalol for rate and rhythm control.
* The patient's lung cancer was treated with radiation therapy (XRT) to the lung.

**Diagnostic Tests:**

* Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed a normal QTc interval.
* Chest X-ray (CXR) showed worsening of a left pleural effusion.
* Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest showed progression of left hilar masses, causing obliteration of the left main bronchus.
* Echocardiogram showed regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%.

**Medications:**

* The patient was discharged on a variety of medications, including sotalol, simvastatin, latanoprost, acetaminophen, colace, bisacodyl, miralax, senna, fentanyl, simethicone, compazine, zantac, megestrol, ativan, dilaudid, dextromethorphan-guaifenesin, mirtazapine, and nystatin.

**Discharge Disposition:**

* The patient was discharged home with services.

**Discharge Diagnosis:**

* Primary: atrial fibrillation s/p electrical cardioversion, NSTEMI, systolic heart failure (sCHF) with an EF of 40%, neutropenic on neupogen, metastatic poorly differentiated squamous lung cancer on carboplatin/taxol, and hemoptysis undergoing XRT.
* Secondary: depression.

**Discharge Condition:**

* The patient was afebrile, with stable vital signs, tolerating POs, oxygenating well off oxygen, and had intermittent hemoptysis.

**Discharge Instructions:**

* The patient was instructed to take all medications as prescribed, attend all scheduled follow-up appointments, and contact their physician if they develop shortness of breath that is not improved with home oxygen. They were also advised to be compliant with a salt-restricted diet.
