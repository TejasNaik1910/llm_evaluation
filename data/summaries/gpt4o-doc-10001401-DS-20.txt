**Chief Complaint:**
- Subjective fevers, lethargy, and bloody drain output.

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedures:**
1. CT-guided repositioning of existing drain and placement of an additional drain for large pelvic fluid collections.
2. Removal of more recently placed drain.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient, with a history of hypertension and high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma (pT2b), underwent TAH/BSO, radical cystectomy with ileal conduit, complicated by intra-abdominal infection and pelvic fluid collection. She presented with 2 days of malaise and 1 day of fevers. Initial management included CT-guided JP drain placement for intra-abdominal fluid collection. She was started on zosyn and vancomycin and transferred for further management.

**Past Medical History:**
- Hypertension
- s/p laparoscopic cholecystectomy
- s/p left knee replacement
- s/p laminectomy of L5-S1
- Bladder cancer (high-grade TCC, T1, then T4 staging)
- s/p hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy
- s/p radical cystectomy and anterior vaginectomy with ileal conduit creation
- History of LLE DVT and PE on lovenox

**Physical Exam:**
- **Admission:** Fever (100.9Â°F), tachycardia, mild LLQ pain, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds, and serosanguinous fluid from LLQ drain.
- **Discharge:** Afebrile, stable vitals, clear lungs, and serosanguinous fluid from LLQ drain.

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Admission Labs:** Elevated WBC (19.4), anemia (Hgb 6.9), elevated creatinine (1.1), low albumin (2.5).
- **Discharge Labs:** Improved WBC (6.9), anemia (Hgb 8.3), normalized creatinine (0.8).
- **Microbiology:** Blood cultures pending, pelvic fluid culture negative.
- **Imaging:** CT and CTA showed changes in pelvic fluid collections and severe bilateral hydronephrosis.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- **Pelvic Fluid Collections:** Managed with drain placement and repositioning. Cultures negative for infection. Transitioned to IV ertapenem for 4 weeks.
- **Pulmonary Embolism:** Managed with lovenox, transitioned to heparin for procedures, then back to lovenox.
- **Acute Renal Injury:** Resolved during hospital stay.
- **Hydronephrosis:** Stable, no immediate intervention required.
- **Anemia:** Treated with 2 units of pRBC, improved hemoglobin levels.
- **Hypokalemia:** Managed with oral KCl.

**Chronic Issues:**
- Invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma with no current plan for chemo/radiation.
- Left breast mass (BI-RADS 5) under evaluation.
- Hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism managed with atorvastatin and levothyroxine, respectively.

**Medications on Admission:**
- Acetaminophen, atorvastatin, enoxaparin, levothyroxine, lorazepam.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Ertapenem, milk of magnesia, enoxaparin, acetaminophen, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, lorazepam.

**Discharge Disposition:**
- Extended Care Facility

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- Primary: Pelvic fluid collection infection, acute blood loss anemia.
- Secondary: Acute renal failure, acute on chronic anemia, recent pulmonary embolism, invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma, left breast mass (BI-RADS 5), hypothyroidism.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Continue follow-up for lung and breast lesions.
- Continue Lovenox for PE.
- Follow up with infectious disease and urology.
- Repeat CT scan before ID appointment.
- IV antibiotics for several weeks as determined by ID team.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
- Weekly lab draws and follow-up appointments as specified.
