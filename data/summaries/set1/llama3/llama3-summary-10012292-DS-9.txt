Here is a summary of the clinical note in 500 words or less:

The patient is a female with a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, status post thyroidectomy and chemotherapy-radiation therapy. She was admitted to the hospital with fever, cough, and nausea. Her past medical history also includes papillary thyroid cancer, esophageal strictures, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, heart murmur, lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, and osteopenia.

Upon admission, the patient's vitals were normal, and her physical exam revealed a cachectic appearance, dense breath sounds at the right base, and no acute distress. Her labs showed no leukocytosis, but an elevated percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs). A chest X-ray revealed a new retrocardiac opacity, and she was started on antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

During her hospital stay, the patient underwent a video swallowing study, which showed penetration without frank aspiration and an upper esophageal stricture. A CT scan of the chest revealed multifocal consolidation in the right lung, suggesting an infectious process, and a left apical pulmonary nodule that will be evaluated on a follow-up CT scan. The patient was treated with antibiotics, and her symptoms improved. She was also evaluated by the GI team and underwent repeat dilation of esophageal strictures without complication.

The patient's medications upon admission included levothyroxine, octreotide, hydrochlorothiazide, pentoxifylline, calcium, vitamin D, and multivitamin. Her discharge medications included antibiotics, calcium, vitamin D, and inhalers for shortness of breath or wheezing.

The patient's discharge diagnosis included bacterial aspiration pneumonia, hypertension, esophageal stricture, and hypocalcemia. Her secondary diagnoses were metastatic medullary thyroid cancer and malnutrition. Her discharge condition was stable and afebrile.

The patient was instructed to complete 12 days of antibiotics, increase her calcium intake, and use inhalers as needed. She was also advised to crush her medications and take them with food to prevent further aspiration. Follow-up instructions included a return to the hospital if she developed shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, fever, or other concerning symptoms.
