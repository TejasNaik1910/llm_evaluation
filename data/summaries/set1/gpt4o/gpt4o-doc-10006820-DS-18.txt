**Chief Complaint:**
- Left leg swelling

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:**
- IVC filter placement

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient, a [Redacted]-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, presented with left lower extremity pain. During a routine cardiology appointment, he was found to have a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left gastrocnemius vein via ultrasound. He was previously diagnosed with afib with symptomatic rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was on metoprolol and dabigatran. He developed GI bleeding 6 weeks ago, leading to the discontinuation of dabigatran. Despite treatment for hemorrhoids, the bleeding persisted, and he was hospitalized, receiving 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy, and a failed capsule endoscopy. The patient noticed left lower extremity pain and swelling 6 days prior to this admission.

**Past Medical History:**
- Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) due to NSAID use
- Atrial fibrillation
- Recent GI bleeding

**Social History:**
- Lives alone, semi-retired, former smoker, no alcohol or intravenous drug use, active at baseline

**Family History:**
- No family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE)

**Physical Exam:**
- Vitals: 97.6Â°F, HR 54, BP 100/56, RR 20, weight 165 lbs
- General: No acute distress, comfortable
- HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM
- Neck: No carotid bruits, no JVD
- Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, normal bowel sounds, no organomegaly
- Extremities: Subtle left lower extremity non-pitting edema, left varicose veins, palpable tender cord in medial calf, distal pulses intact bilaterally, extremities warm and well-perfused, no erythema
- Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3, normal strength and sensation in all extremities

**Pertinent Results:**
- Admission Labs: HCT 27, INR 1.0, WBC 4.3 with 9% eosinophils
- Discharge Labs: WBC 4.1, RBC 3.42, Hgb 9.9, Hct 32.3, MCV 94, MCH 29.0, MCHC 30.8, RDW 15.0, Glucose 93, UreaN 11, Creat 0.8, Na 143, K 4.7, Cl 109, HCO3 22, AnGap 17, Calcium 9.1, Phos 3.9, Mg 2.1
- Studies: IVC gram/filter pending, ECHO showed LVEF 55-60%, normal biventricular systolic function, mild biatrial enlargement, ultrasound confirmed left gastrocnemius vein DVT

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- **Left Gastroc DVT:** Diagnosed during a cardiology appointment, treated with a heparin drip in the ED. Due to recent GI bleed, an IVC filter was placed to avoid anticoagulation. Follow-up for filter removal and hematology referral for hypercoagulable workup planned.
- **Recent GI Bleed:** No source identified on endoscopy or colonoscopy. Dabigatran was discontinued. The patient remained guaiac negative during hospitalization and was started on iron.
- **Atrial Fibrillation:** Currently in normal sinus rhythm on metoprolol. Discussion ongoing regarding future anticoagulation.
- **Code Status:** Full
- **Emergency Contact:** Friend [Redacted]

**Discharge Plan:**
- **Medications:** Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg PO daily, Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg PO daily
- **Follow-up:** Appointments with PCP, cardiologist for IVC filter removal, hematologist for hypercoagulable workup, and gastroenterologist for further GI evaluation.
- **Discharge Condition:** Clear mental status, alert, and ambulatory.

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- Left gastrocnemius DVT

**Discharge Instructions:**
- The patient was informed about the temporary nature of the IVC filter and the need for its removal in 3 months. Follow-up with cardiology, hematology, and gastroenterology was emphasized to address the DVT, potential hypercoagulable state, and GI bleeding source.
