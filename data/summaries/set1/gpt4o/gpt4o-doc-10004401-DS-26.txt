**Chief Complaint:**
- Fatigue

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:**
- Upper Endoscopy

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient, with a significant past medical history (PMH) including coronary artery disease (CAD) status post (s/p) stenting, dual chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial tachycardia/fibrillation, rectal cancer s/p chemoradiation and surgery, colostomy, and stroke with right hand dysthesia, was referred due to progressive fatigue and low hematocrit (Hct).

**Symptoms:**
- Mild dyspnea on exertion, chronic fatigue, stable orthopnea, nocturia, chronic leg swelling, no dark stools, BRBPR, hematemesis, chest pain, or palpitations.

**Past Medical History:**
- Ventricular tachycardia, dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 35-40%, CAD s/p stenting, chronic systolic CHF, atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, rectal cancer s/p chemoradiation and surgery, GI bleed from duodenal angiectasia, CVA with right hand dysthesia, prior mechanical falls, depression.

**Family History:**
- Father died from MI, mother died from PE, twin sister died of colitis. No family history of colon, breast, uterine, or ovarian cancer.

**Physical Exam:**
- Vitals: T: 96.0, BP: 104/55, P: 69, R: 25, O2: 95% on 2L
- General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
- HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
- Neck: Supple, JVD to jaw, positive HJR, no LAD
- Lungs: Central ronchi clearing with cough, no crackles, clear, no wheezes
- CV: RRR, S1, Split S2, soft systolic murmur at apex and LLSB, no rubs/gallops
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, liver edge palpated 3cm under rib line, colostomy LLQ
- Extremities: Severe stasis dermatitis bilaterally, no signs of DVT, bilateral +3 pitting edema
- Neuro: No gross deficit

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Admission Labs:** Notable for microcytic anemia (Hct 24.7), low iron, elevated LDH, normal B12 and folate, negative celiac serology.
- **Imaging:** EKG showed A-V paced rhythm with ventricular premature beat, CXR indicated cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
- **Echo:** LVEF 40%, moderate mitral regurgitation, mild global left ventricular hypokinesis, moderate right ventricular dilation.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- **Anemia:** Multifactorial, likely due to iron deficiency, chronic renal failure (CRF), and chronic disease. Received 3 units of PRBC, iron supplementation started, and further outpatient workup planned.
- **CHF Exacerbation:** Managed with home doses of PO furosemide, additional IV furosemide, and PRBC. Fluid status improved to euvolemia at discharge.
- **Jaundice:** Likely due to congested liver secondary to right heart failure. Further outpatient workup planned.
- **Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:** Likely pre-renal failure due to decompensated heart failure. Renal function improved with treatment.
- **Fever:** Occurred during blood transfusion, no concerning findings on workup, remained afebrile.
- **Atrial Fibrillation:** Managed with beta-blockers and warfarin, INR monitoring continued.
- **CAD:** Follow-up with outpatient cardiologist, consideration for aspirin and statin initiation.

**Medications on Admission:**
- Lisinopril, warfarin, Toprol XL, triamcinolone cream, omeprazole, lasix, spironolactone, potassium chloride.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Toprol XL, triamcinolone acetonide cream, omeprazole, spironolactone, lisinopril, warfarin, potassium chloride, furosemide, iron, Vitamin C, Colace, senna.

**Discharge Disposition:**
- Home

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- Anemia, iron deficiency, suspected hemolysis, heart failure exacerbation

**Discharge Condition:**
- Mental Status: Clear and coherent
- Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive
- Activity Status: Ambulatory with assistance

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Undergo lower endoscopy (colonoscopy) for further evaluation of potential GI bleeding.
- Continue medications as adjusted.
- Monitor weight daily and follow up with PCP and cardiologist.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
- Check CBC at PCP's appointment.
