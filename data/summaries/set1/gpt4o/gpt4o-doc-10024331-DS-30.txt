**Chief Complaint:**
- Bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR)

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:**
- Sigmoidoscopy

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient is a male with a history of prostate cancer (T3b N0 M0, Gleason 4+3, stage III), radiation proctitis post-argon laser treatment, atrial fibrillation on Pradaxa, and coronary artery disease post-multiple stent placements. He presented with BRBPR, initially noticing streaks on toilet paper, which progressed to significant blood loss. He also reported dull, band-like lower abdominal pain and a brief episode of chest pain relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin.

**Diagnostic Tests and Findings:**
- **EKG:** Normal sinus rhythm, QTc 480s, nonspecific ST changes.
- **CXR:** Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, possible trace pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
- **CT Abdomen/Pelvis:** Possible mild rectal wall thickening, renal hypodense lesions.
- **Labs:** Initial HCT 34.0, Cr 1.5 (baseline 1.2), INR 1.7. Discharge labs showed HCT 31.4, Cr 1.8.
- **Sigmoidoscopy:** Findings consistent with radiation proctitis, treated with argon plasma coagulation.

**Hospital Course:**
- The patient was admitted for monitoring, serial hematocrits, and a planned sigmoidoscopy. He received intravenous fluids and was transfused with 4 units of PRBCs. During his stay, he remained hemodynamically stable, and his bleeding stopped post-sigmoidoscopy.

**Active Issues:**
1. **Radiation Proctitis:** Treated with argon plasma coagulation during sigmoidoscopy. The patient remained stable post-procedure.
2. **Chest Pain:** Likely related to mild blood loss. EKGs and troponins were negative for acute coronary syndrome.
3. **Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation:** Managed with Pradaxa, which was temporarily held due to bleeding risk and sigmoidoscopy preparation. Amiodarone was continued, and metoprolol was temporarily held.
4. **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):** Suspected pre-renal etiology due to GI bleeding. Managed with intravenous fluids.

**Inactive Issues:**
- Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus Type II, Parkinsonism, Gout, Prostate Cancer (in remission post-hormonal therapy with Lupron), and other chronic conditions were managed as per standard protocols.

**Medications on Admission:**
- Amiodarone, Amitriptyline/Ketoprofen/Lidocaine, Atorvastatin, Carbidopa-Levodopa, Colchicine, Cyclobenzaprine, Dabigatran (Pradaxa), Furosemide, Glipizide, Metoprolol, Nitroglycerin, Selegiline, Aspirin.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Continued all admission medications with instructions to restart Pradaxa post-procedure.

**Discharge Disposition:**
- Home

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- Primary: Radiation Proctitis, Chest Pain
- Secondary: Prostate Cancer, Coronary Artery Disease, Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation, Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Parkinsonism, CKD

**Discharge Condition:**
- Clear mental status, alert, interactive, and ambulatory.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Restart Pradaxa as previously prescribed. Follow up for repeat sigmoidoscopy in a few weeks. Monitor weight daily and limit physical activity for the next three days.

**Follow-up:**
- Scheduled follow-up for repeat sigmoidoscopy and routine monitoring of chronic conditions.
