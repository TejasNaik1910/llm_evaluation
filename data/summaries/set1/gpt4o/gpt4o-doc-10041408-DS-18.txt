- No family history of pancreatic or GI malignancy.

**Physical Exam:**
- **Admission:** Temp 97.7°F, BP 114/70, HR 79, R 18, O2-sat 100% RA. Middle-aged female, sleepy but comfortable.
- **Discharge:** Temp 99.2°F, BP 100-120s/50-80s, HR 90-100s, O2-sat 94% on 2L. Middle-aged female, minimal distress, slow responses, inattentive.

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Labs:**
  - On admission: WBC 6.9, Hgb 9.3, Hct 27.5, ESR 108, CRP 16.6.
  - On discharge: WBC 7.8, Hgb 8.1, Hct 23.5.
- **Microbiology:**
  - Hepatic abscess fluid: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Viridans streptococci.
- **Imaging:**
  - CT abdomen: Post-RFA hypodensity with air foci, minimal decrease in size, new small right pleural effusion, and bilateral bibasilar atelectasis.

**Hospital Course:**
- **Bradycardia:** Likely medication effect or vasovagal reaction. Monitored on telemetry with no further events.
- **Liver Abscess:** Treated with meropenem, then switched to ceftriaxone and metronidazole. Drainage catheter upsized due to minimal decrease in abscess size.
- **Pain Management:** Persistent pain at drain site, managed with dilaudid regimen. Consulted palliative care for pain management.
- **Pleural Effusion:** Small effusion noted, managed with oxygen therapy and incentive spirometry.

**Medications on Admission:**
- Enoxaparin, Citalopram, Bupropion, Multivitamins, Vitamin D, Lidocaine (viscous and patch), Lamotrigine, Clonazepam, Aripiprazole, Ondansetron, Senna, Docusate, Acetaminophen.

- Follow-up with primary oncologist and Infectious Disease clinic.
- Pain management with dilaudid, titrate as needed.
- Use oxygen to maintain O2 saturation >91%.

**Follow-up:**
- Weekly lab work (CBC, BMP, LFTs) to be faxed to ID nurse.
