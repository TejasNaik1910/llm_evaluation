**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient has stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma with liver metastases and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), acalculous cholecystitis, and recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She presented with upper abdominal pain, different from her usual pain, and was found to have acute acalculous cholecystitis on a CT scan. She was transferred for further evaluation and management.

**Diagnostic Tests Conducted:**
- **CT Scan:** Confirmed acute acalculous cholecystitis.
- **KUB:** Pancreatic duct stent in appropriate positioning.
- **TTE:** Suspicion for malignant thrombotic process with masses on the mitral valve, possible thrombus in the coronary sinus, moderate pulmonary hypertension.
- **LENIS:** Superficial occlusive thrombus in the right greater saphenous vein.
- **CTV (IVCF study):** Appropriately positioned IVC filter, pancreatic head mass, extensive hepatic metastasis, stable small volume ascites, and anasarca.
- **Liver US:** Gallbladder with intraluminal sludge, unchanged hepatic metastases, unchanged dilation of the main pancreatic duct.
- **CT Abd/Pelvis:** No significant change in pancreatic head mass or hepatic metastatic disease, stable small volume ascites, new small splenic infarct.
- **ERCP:** Removal of PD stent and metal biliary stent, plastic biliary stent placed.
- **CT Chest:** Bilateral upper lobe predominant multifocal ground-glass opacities, linear areas of filling defects in multiple bilateral subsegmental branches.

**Medications:**
- **Admission Medications:** Acetaminophen, Aspirin, BuPROPion XL, Clopidogrel, HYDROmorphone, LORazepam, Morphine SR, Prochlorperazine, Senna, Sertraline, Pantoprazole, Metoprolol Tartrate, Ondansetron, Rivaroxaban.

**Surgical Interventions:**
- Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement for acalculous cholecystitis.
- ERCP with removal of PD stent and metal biliary stent, placement of plastic biliary stent.

**Patient's Response to Treatment:**
- Initial improvement in abdominal pain post-procedure, but experienced transient drain site pain.
- Bile cultures grew Clostridium perfringens and gram-negative rods, treated with antibiotics.
- Transitioned to comfort-focused care and hospice due to terminal diagnosis and progression of metastatic pancreatic cancer.

**Discharge Disposition:**
- Transferred to hospice care for symptom management related to advanced cancer.

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- Acalculous cholecystitis
- Marantic endocarditis
- Pulmonary embolism
- Anasarca
- Leukocytosis
- Acute on chronic anemia
- Metastatic pancreatic cancer

**Discharge Condition:**
- Mental Status: Confused at times.
- Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.
- Activity Status: Ambulatory with assistance.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Focus on comfort care at hospice, continue antibiotics and anticoagulation as desired, manage symptoms of nausea, pain, and confusion.
