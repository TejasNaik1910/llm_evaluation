**Family History:**
- Niece had cancer. Father died of lung disease. Mother died of unknown cause. No early CAD or sudden cardiac death. No other known history of cancer.

**Physical Exam:**
- **Admission:** Pleasant affect, resting comfortably, minimal bibasilar crackles, right calf swelling greater than left, no calf tenderness, thick toenails, dry skin along toes, hallux valgus.
- **Discharge:** Similar findings with stable vitals, mild right calf swelling, and non-tender indurated cord in left antecubital fossa.

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Admission Labs:** Anemia (Hgb 7.7), elevated creatinine (2.9), and other abnormalities.
- **Imaging:** Bilateral lower extremity Doppler ultrasound showed bilateral posterior tibial vein DVTs. CT head non-contrast showed no acute infarction or hemorrhage.
- **EGD:** Showed severe gastritis, superficial ulcerations, and a medium hiatal hernia but no active bleeding.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- **DVT Management:** Treated with heparin drip, transitioned to warfarin. Hematology consulted due to bleeding complications. Clopidogrel was stopped.
- **Upper GI Bleed:** Managed with EGD and high-dose PPI. No active bleeding found.
- **Left Antecubital Hematoma:** Managed by holding and restarting heparin drip.
- **CKD Management:** Improved with hydration. Home medications adjusted.
- **Anemia:** Likely related to CKD and possible slow GI bleed.
- **Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF):** Adjusted medications due to GI bleed.
- **CAD:** Managed with adjustments to medications due to bleeding risk.
- **HTN and Diabetes:** Medications adjusted accordingly.

**Medications on Admission:**
- Included Lisinopril, Allopurinol, Atorvastatin, Carvedilol, Clopidogrel, Furosemide, Ranitidine, Aspirin, Multivitamins, Vitamin D, Nifedipine, Nitroglycerin, and insulin.
