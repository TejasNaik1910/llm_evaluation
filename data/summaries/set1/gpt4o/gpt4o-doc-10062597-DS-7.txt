**Chief Complaint:**
- Atrial clot

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:**
- Bronchoscopy

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient is a [Redacted]-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) on a kinase inhibitor study drug. A routine CT scan revealed a right atrial tumor thrombus and a right common iliac artery clot. She was advised to go to the nearest emergency department (ED) and was subsequently transferred to [Redacted] for further care. In the ED, she was started on a heparin drip. Vascular surgery recommended monitoring without immediate intervention due to the presence of dopplerable pulses and no significant symptoms.

**Past Medical History:**
- Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
- Cavernous sinus thrombosis
- Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH/BSO)

**Social History:**
- [Redacted]

**Family History:**
- Non-contributory

**Physical Exam:**
- Vitals: T: 98.2Â°F, BP: 110/75 mmHg, HR: 101-115 bpm, O2 Sat: 93% on 4L nasal cannula
- General: Well-appearing, no acute distress
- HEENT: Normal
- Neck: No JVD, no lymphadenopathy
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs
- Pulmonary: Bronchial breath sounds bilaterally, right upper lobe crackles
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended
- Extremities: Right foot cool with dopplerable pulses, normal sensation
- Neurological: Alert, oriented, normal strength and sensation
- Skin: No jaundice, cyanosis, or dermatitis

**Pertinent Results:**
- Blood tests showed mild anemia and elevated PTT.
- CT Torso: Left atrial tumor thrombus, right common iliac artery clot, stable bilateral airspace consolidation.
- Portable TTE: Left atrial mass, normal left ventricular function, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
- Bronchoscopy: No endobronchial lesions or bleeding, therapeutic aspiration performed.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- **Arterial Thrombus:** Managed with heparin drip, transitioned to enoxaparin (Lovenox) before discharge. No surgical intervention required.
- **Lung Cancer:** Continued on baseline oxygen, cough suppressants, albuterol, and pain management with Vicodin.
- **Hemoptysis:** Managed with bronchoscopy, no active bleeding found, symptoms improved.
- **Tachycardia:** Monitored on telemetry, attributed to atrial thrombus and hypoxia. No surgical intervention deemed beneficial due to disease extent.

**Medications on Admission:**
- Albuterol, Benzonatate, Fioricet-Codeine, Codeine-Guaifenesin, Flurazepam, Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen, Lorazepam, Oxygen, Prochlorperazine, Trazodone, Loperamide, Omeprazole.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Albuterol, Benzonatate, Codeine-Guaifenesin, Flurazepam, Oxygen, Trazodone, Acetaminophen, Diphenhydramine, Omeprazole, Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen, Enoxaparin.

**Discharge Disposition:**
- Home with services

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
- Left atrial thrombus
- Right common iliac artery thrombus

**Discharge Condition:**
- Stable, with O2 saturations in the low 90s on 4L nasal cannula

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Continue home medications and start Lovenox as directed. Follow up with Dr. [Redacted] and oncologist. An echocardiogram is scheduled in [Redacted] weeks. Seek immediate medical attention for any concerning symptoms.
