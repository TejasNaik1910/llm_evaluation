**Brief Hospital Course:**
- **Post-Op:** Patient stable with minimal pain. Chest tube (CT) placed on suction, diet advanced as tolerated.
- **POD 1:** Mild incisional pain, managed with Dilaudid. Started on Colace, oxygen saturation (O2 sat) 93-95% on 4L nasal cannula (NC), weaned to 2L NC. Diet tolerated, IV fluids decreased. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed little change in left chest tube position and extensive opacification in the left lung.
- **POD 2:** Stable on telemetry, CT on suction with serosanguinous output, no leak or crepitus. Weaned to 1.5L NC, reported one bowel movement (BM). CXR unchanged, consistent with post-surgical changes or residual lung mass.
- **POD 3:** CT placed to water seal, weaned off oxygen, maintained O2 sat at 93% on room air (RA). Pain controlled with Tylenol. Discharge planning initiated. CXR showed a new loculated pneumothorax in the left upper lung.
- **POD 4:** Stable with good oral intake, adequate urine output (UOP), minimal pain. CT clamped, repeat CXR showed stable loculation.
- **POD 5:** Stable, CT removed uneventfully, post-pull CXR ordered. Stable vitals prior to discharge.
