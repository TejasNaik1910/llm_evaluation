**Chief Complaint:**
- Leg weakness, known T12 lesion

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedures:**
1. Anterior arthrodesis T11-L1
2. Application of interbody cage T11-L1
3. Biopsy of T12 vertebral body
4. Posterior arthrodesis T10-L2
5. Posterolateral posterior instrumentation T10-L2 segmental
6. Open treatment of fracture dislocation from metastatic disease and destruction of the T12 vertebral body
7. Laminectomy of partial L1, all of T12, and the inferior aspect of T11
8. Application of allograft

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient, an elderly female with a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) secondary to an aneurysm, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and a recent work-up for multiple myeloma, presented with leg weakness and multiple falls. She experienced a significant fall at home, leading to a decline in mobility and increased back pain. Initial imaging (plain films and head CT) was normal, but a subsequent spine CT revealed findings consistent with multiple myeloma involving multiple levels and an associated mass at T12 compressing the thecal sac.

**Diagnostic Tests Conducted:**
- **CT Head:** No acute intracranial hemorrhage, stable bifrontal encephalomalacia.
- **Thoracolumbar Spine X-ray:** Status post posterior fusion from T10 through L2 with a T12 corpectomy.
- **MRI Spine:** Status post T12 corpectomy and T10-L2 fusion, severe encroachment on the distal spinal cord due to fluid collection.
- **Blood Tests:** Elevated WBC, anemia, hypercalcemia, and hemolyzed potassium levels.
- **Urine Culture:** Positive for Escherichia coli.

**Surgical Interventions:**
- The patient underwent decompression surgery (T10-L2 fusion, T12 corpectomy) performed by the Ortho-Spine Team.

**Medications:**
- **On Admission:** Lasix, Pravastatin, Allopurinol, Colchicine, Aggrenox, Cozaar, Atenolol.
- **Discharge Medications:** Atenolol, Diltiazem, Furosemide, Losartan, Pravastatin, Acetaminophen, Bisacodyl, Docusate Sodium, Fentanyl Patch, Heparin, Insulin, Oxycodone, Polyethylene Glycol, Ranitidine, Senna, Dipyridamole-Aspirin, Sulfameth/Trimethoprim, Allopurinol, Dexamethasone.

**Hospital Course:**
- The patient was admitted with profound lower extremity weakness and was started on high-dose dexamethasone. Post-surgery, she experienced increased pain and leg weakness, which improved with better pain management. She was also treated for a UTI with antibiotics and managed for hypercalcemia and anemia. The patient was transferred to the Neurology service for better management of her leg weakness and pain.

**Discharge Disposition:**
- The patient was discharged to an extended care facility with instructions to wear a TLSO brace during ambulation attempts. She was set up for radiation therapy for her multiple myeloma.

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
- **Primary:** T12 destruction spinal lesion - resected
- **Secondary:** Post-surgical leg weakness, likely related to pain and deconditioning

**Follow-up Instructions:**
- The patient is to follow up in the clinic after radiation therapy.
