IMAGING
-------
___ RUQ US:
FINDINGS: 
There are innumerable, confluent hepatic metastases.  There are 
no focal liver lesions.  The gallbladder wall appears normal and 
there are no stones.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic bile 
duct dilation.  The common bile duct is 3 mm in diameter.  The 
visualized portion of the pancreas appears normal.  The spleen 
is without focal lesion and measures 11.4 cm in length.  There 
is moderate ascites.  Evaluation of the bilateral kidneys 
reveals no stones, masses, or hydronephrosis.  The right kidney 
measures 10.2 cm and the left kidney 9.2 cm in length. 
  
The main, left, anterior right and anterior left portal veins 
are patent with hepatopetal flow.  The imaged portion of the 
abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava is normal.   
  
IMPRESSION:   
1. Extensive hepatic metastatic disease.   
2. Moderate ascites. 
3. Patent intrahepatic portal venous system. 
4. Normal biliary system. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, ___ yo woman with diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer 
(dx ___ s/p hormonal tx in the past (not on Rx currently) who 
presents with second epidose of ascites. Her disease is 
complicated by hepatic metastases. Her first was earlier this 
month, and cytology was negative for malignancy. She is not on 
home diuretics.

# Ascites: No history of cirrhosis, HPS, HRS, varices. Likely 
due to infiltration of liver by metastatic disease. Admitted for 
paracentesis related to likely malignant ascites. History of 1 
previous paracentesis earlier this month for ascites (cytology 
negative). Likely in need of regularly scheduled paracentesis 
versus placement of peritoneal catheter for ongoing drainage. 
Patient has decreased UOP subjectively at home, though likely 
not oliguric by I/O here. Does not apparently have HRS, unknown 
if compartment syndrome. Stable Cr would suggest not. 
Historically, liver enzymes greatly elevated, but INR normal 
indicating fair synthetic fxn. Pleural fluid revealed WBC ~100, 
albumin <1, cytology was pending at discharge.

# Abdominal pain:  Most likely due to worsening metastatic 
disease and ascites as per prior history and should improve with 
tapping. RUQ US showed that there was no portal vein thrombosis 
or biliary obstruction. There was no evidence for SBP on 
peritoneal fluid analysis or for cholangitis on US.

# Metastatic breast cancer
Currently on alternative therapy with GcMAF which has a large 
amount of information on the internet, but it remains unclear 
how effective or safe the treatment is. Drug is currently in 
"preclinical" trials. Has been on tamoxifen, Lupron, Femara in 
past. S/p oophorectomy. Never took capecitabine, avastin, or 
taxol in past. She was seen by ___ in palliative care 
and the patient decided to discharge home with hospice services 
and to sign a DNR/DNI form. She has both oncology and palliative 
care follow up appointments to discuss a palliative Pleurex 
catheter.

# Hyperkalemia: ___ be related to mild renal impairment. 
Difficult to interpret hemolysis as her progressive liver 
disease could make Tbili and LDH high independent of cell 
turnover. However, most of bilirubin was direct, suggesting 
she's not hemolyzing. This may have been related to mild 
pre-renal ___ prior to admission secondary to third spaced 
fluid. She was treated with some IVF. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-recheck potassium
-discuss placement of Pleurex catheter, which patient is 
amenable to

Discharge Instructions:
Hi Ms. ___, you were admitted for abdominal pain and 
distension. You recently were admitted for a similar issue a 
couple of weeks ago and your symptoms improved with removal of 
the abdominal fluid, called ascites. Last time you were here the 
ascites did not appear infected, but there were also no 
malignant cells seen under the microscope. We believe that your 
recurrent distension and ascites are related to worsening liver 
involvement of your cancer. We had your ascites drained and the 
fluid analyzed. We also did an ultrasound of your liver to make 
sure the veins did not have clots and that the bile system was 
draining properly. These tests showed significant tumor in your 
liver, but no blood clots in the veins or evidence of 
obstruction of the bile drainage. The ascites fluid did not 
appear to be infected. We felt it safe to discharge you. In the 
future you may need a long term catheter placed in your abdomen 
to allow repeated drainage of your ascites.

It is important that you follow up with your outpatient doctors 
regarding further treatment for your cancer, whether palliative 
or otherwise. 

You were discharged home with hospice services and a 
prescription for hydromorphone (a pain medication).
 
Followup Instructions:
