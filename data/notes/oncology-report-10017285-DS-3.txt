History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old man with lung cancer with brain metastases 
previously on anticoagulation for PE, transferred to the MICU 
from the SICU in the setting of arrythmias, most prominently 
tachyarrythmias, who originally presented to medical care on 
___ late morning after being found by his family, lying down on 
the sidewalk outside of his home, minimally responsive. He awoke 
at the scene complaining of headache and left shoulder pain. He 
was taken to ___ and then taken by MedFlight to 
___ after a CT showed extensive acute ICH. An EKG there showed 
sinus rhythm, with an S in I and a Q in III, with prominent 
upright T waves in precordial leads and no indication of 
ischemia. He reportedly started the flight being AOx3 and 
following commands and then deteriorated into lethargy and 
minimal responsiveness. He was intubated for airway protection. 
Of note, his INR was 3.7 on arrival to ___ consistent with 
coumadin taken regularly at home for known PE in ___. 
He received 2 units of FFP and vitamin K.  
.  
At ___ he was admitted to the SICU on the neurosurgical 
service. Ultimately, neurosurgery decided to observe the 
patient, start seizure prophylaxis, normalize INR (with a 
recommendation to avoid anticoagulation for one month) with no 
indication for neurosurgical intervention. He was diagnosed with 
a left humeral fracture for which orthopedics recommended 
splint. He was extubated on ___. An IVC filter was placed on 
___.  
.  
Of note in terms of his functional status prior to the event, he 
had not had recent falls prior to this. However, prior to his 
diagnosis with brain mets, he had a persistent cough and had 
some prior episodes, unwitnessed by family and only uncovered in 
retrospect, in which he coughed violently and then fell down, 
perhaps similar to this presentation. He was until this 
admission able to perform basic ADLs, ambulating, toileting, 
eating, etc; though with low energy and slow mobility.

Pertinent Results:
LEFT SHOULDER, THREE VIEWS ___: There is a fracture 
involving the proximal shaft of the left femur. There is 
displacement by approximately one shaft width with apex lateral 
angulation of the fracture site. 

CT ___: "extensive acute ICH identified which all
appears to be extra-xial and is most prominent superficial to 
the
anterior left frontal lobe, but there is less extensive acute 
ICH
along the right anterolateral aspect of the suprasellar cistern,
right side of the anterior cranial fossa, left ambient cistern,
along the adjacent left tentorium cerebelli, and along the 
sulcus
posterior right frontal lobe".
 
___: Left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural
blood measuring up to 6mm and layering along the falx. No
signficant mass effect. No intraventricular hemorrhage. 5 x 9 mm
focus of hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe. No e/o aneurysm
or vascular abnl. 
   CTA: 1. Left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural 
hematoma without evidence of significant mass effect. 2. Small 
focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage or intraparenchymal hemorrhage 
in 
the right parietal lobe. 3. Small amount of intraventricular 
hemorrhage in the left perimesencephalic cistern. 4. 
Unremarkable CTA of the head. 

Repeat CTA ___: IMPRESSION: 1. Previously noted left 
frontal hypodensity and subarachnoid hemorrhages as well as

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old ___ speaking gentleman found down and taken to 
outside hospital where CT scan revealed left frontal tentorial 
cistern acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. He was 
transported by medflight to ___ when his mental status 
deteriorated in flight. He was intubated for a GCS of 7  at 
arrival and recieved profiline and FFP in ED. He also sustained 
a left humeral fracture that was splinted by ortho trauma. On 
___ he was found to have a left lower lobe mass. He remained 
intubated becuase he did not tolerate CPAP. On ___, the patient 
was extubated and placed on nimodipine for subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. On physical exam, patient was awake, following 
commands, giving thumbs up and moving R>L. Pupils were equal and 
reactive. On ___, cardiology was consulted for arrthymias seen 
on telemetry and nimoedipine was discontinued, as no vasospasm 
was seen on CTA. On ___, a repeat head CT scan showed a stable 
intra-cranial bleed. Patient did not sustain any further 
injuries to the body per trauma. Family meeting was conducted to 
discuss goals of care and patient was made DNR/DNI. Patient was 
transferred out of the ICU to the medicine floor to coordinate 
recommendations of consult services and to initiate discharge 
planning.

1. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient's intracranial bleed was 
stable on head CTs on ___ and ___. Patient's mental status 
improved over the course of the admission, becoming more 
interactive, A&Ox2, able to state his address and birthday, 
following commands and moving all four extremities to command. 
It's still unclear why the patient fell initially--the 
differential includes seizure, arrythmia, hypoxia secondary to 
cigarette smoking/lung CA. The patient had cardiac enzymes 
negative x3. He had an echo with above results. Neurosurgery 
followed the patient while admitted, with recommendations to 
hold the patient's Coumadin for (at least) ___s to 
continue seizure prophylaxis with Keppra 1000 mg BID.  Neurology 
and neurosurgery both felt the patient's prognosis was somewhat 
guarded, but may improve in time. As his coumadin had to be 
discontinued, the patient had an IVC filter placed while 
admitted.
.  
2. Arrhthymias: The patient had several episodes of atrial 
tachycardia while on telemetry, as well as one episode of 
bradycardia. This was likely atrial fibrillation secondary to 
the stress of acute event. Cardiology was consulted and 
recommended a low-dose beta blocker for rate control (metoprolol 
12.5mg three times ___. TSH was normal. The patient remained 
hemodynamically stable throughout his admission, with normal 
blood pressure. Cardiology was also concerned that additional 
anti-arrythmic intervention would increase his risk for 
bradycardia, of which the patient had only one concerning 
episode but which would ultimately likely be more problematic 
than his well-perfusing tachycardia. If the patient 
decompensates in the future, a pacemaker could be considered as 
a palliative measure if life expectancy sufficient.   
.  
3. Lung cancer: Per report of family, the patient and his 
oncologist had decided to emphasize on quality of life for the 
last few months given failure to respond to chemo/rads.  The 
patient had a chest CT, showing 8 cm mass of the left lower lobe 
growing into the left main stem bronchus and associated with 
complete collapse of the left lower lobe. This mass may 
contribute to future respiratory compromise via obstruction or 
subsequent pneumonia--however, the patient remained stable from 
a respiratory stand-point throughout his hospitalization, with 
02 saturations >95% on room air and without respiratory 
distress. In the future, if the patient develops respiratory 
distress, intervention on the bronchial mass could be considered 
by interventional pulmonology with stenting or phototherapy.  
These procedures would require intubation with bronchoscopy.  
The patient with follow up with IP as an out-patient.
.  
4. Fever: the patient became febrile on the floor, spiking 
fevers of up to 101.3 (___) on multiple occasions.  Although he 
had no obvious source, with a negative UA and indeterminate CXR 
showing extensive left lung collapse and effusion, the patient 
was begun on coverage for ventilator associated pneumonia with 
IV Cefepime, Vanc, and Flagyl, given his increased risk from 
recent intubation. He will continue this regimen at rehab. Blood 
and urine cultures were pending at discharge.  The patient had 
been afebrile for 24 hours at discharge after 3 days of 
antibiotics.
.
5. Diabetes: While in the hospital, the patient had elevate CBGs 
into the 300s. He was started on a ___ dose of Lantus (14 units) 
prior to discharge.  His blood sugar control can be further 
titrated at rehab.  However, intensive glucose control may 
create sharp swings in glucose, could precipitate arrythmias so 
aggressive glucose control should be avoided. 
.  
6. Hypertension: The patient's systolic blood pressure should be 
kept <180 per neurosurgery recommedation. This was achieved with 
Metoprolol 12.5mg TID, with the patient's blood pressure ranging 
from ___ on day of discharge.
.
7. Left humerus fracture: The patient is being discharged with 
his arm in a sling after splinting by ortho. He will need to 
follow up with ortho as an outpatient.
.
8. Nutrition: The patient was evaluated by the speech and 
swallow with the recommendation to feed the patient thin 
liquids/soft solids with 1:1 supervision. He had a video swallow 
which showed no aspiration.
