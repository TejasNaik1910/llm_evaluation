History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with IDDM, HTN, BPH,
and clear cell RCC s/p radical L nephrectomy (___) metastatic 
to
the lungs, mediastinum, and hilum currently on chemotherapy
(experimental trial; on sunitinib), with recent admission
(___) for biliary stricture s/p ERCP with plastic stent
placement (CBD brushing cytology non-diagnostic) and
non-occlusive portal vein thrombus started on enoxaparin who
presented to the ED with fever, jaundice, and confusion.

The CBD brushing cytology from his prior admission was
non-diagnostic. His imaging was reviewed at multidisciplinary
pancreas conference and no mass lesion was visualized in the 
head
of the pancreas but there was some peripancreatic stranding
around the head of the pancreas noted. There was some concern 
for
a potential primary pancreatobiliary tumor (rather than rare RCC
metastasis to pancreas), so he was planned for a repeat ERCP and
EUS in ___ weeks (planned for the week of ___ off sunatinib).

He last followed up in ___ clinic with Dr. ___ on 
___.
He was complaining of a week of increased fatigue, nausea, and
poor PO intake. His sunatinib was held due to concern for side
effects. Over the past week since then, he has had worsening
jaundice and fatigue. Last night, he developed chills,
restlessness, mild confusion, and fevers to 101, which prompted
his wife to bring him to ___. He was
transferred from there to the ___ ED.

Right now, he feels ok, just a little tired. He feels like his
thinking is foggy. No fevers/chills since he presented to the
hospital. No nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. He has had loose
stools, which he associates with the sunatinib. No bloody, 
black,
or ___ stools. His urine has been "tea colored." He has
had poor appetite. No chest pain, shortness of breath, or
palpitations.

PATHOLOGY/CYTOLOGY:
Biliary mass biopsy (___): Minute fragment of highly 
atypical cells with sclerotic stroma consistent with 
adenocarcinoma
Common bile duct stricture brushings (___):
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. - Adenocarcinoma.

IMAGING:
RUQ US (___):
IMPRESSION: 
1. Persistent mild left intrahepatic biliary dilation in 
presence
of a partially visualized CBD stent raises concern for stent
malfunction.  Compared to the prior ultrasound, the degree of
intrahepatic biliary dilation has not changed significantly. 
2. Persistent gallbladder sludge. 

ERCP ___:
removal of the old stent and placement of a new stent over a 2cm 
malignant-appearing stricture
of the distal CBD. Cytology brushings were sampled.

EUS ___:
1.8 x 1.1 cm ill-defined hypoechoic area around the distal CBD. 
FNB was performed x3

CT torso ___:
IMPRESSION: 
Non obstructive pneumonia, left upper lobe.
Minimal residual pulmonary edema and pleural effusions 
attributable to heart failure.
Atherosclerotic coronary calcification.
Left PICC line ends just above the superior cavoatrial junction.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease in the 
abdomen and
pelvis.
2. Mild intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, 
with CBD
stent in place.
3. Known nonocclusive main portal vein thrombus appears 
increased in size,
though difficult to directly compare to MR due to differences in 
imaging
technique.

ERCP ___: Biliary plastic stent removed with a snare. A 
metal stent was placed over 2cm long malignant appearing 
stricture in the distal CBD. 

TTE ___:
IMPRESSION: Adequate image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global left ventricular systolic function. No 2D 
echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis. If clinically 
suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on 
echocardiography does not exclude the diagnosis of endocarditis.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY/ASSESSMENT:   
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with IDDM, HTN, BPH, and 
metastatic clear cell RCC s/p radical L nephrectomy (___) on 
chemotherapy (sunitinib), with recent admission (___) for 
biliary stricture s/p ERCP with plastic stent placement (CBD 
brushing cytology non-diagnostic) and non-occlusive portal vein 
thrombus started on enoxaparin who presented to the ED with 
fever, jaundice, and confusion, found to have persistent 
intrahepatic biliary dilation and gallbladder sludge on ___ US 
s/p ERCP x2 with placement of plastic, then metal biliary stent 
and EUS with pathology from FNB of CBD mass consistent with new 
pancreatobiliary adenocardinoma. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Cholangitis
# Strep spp. (likely Enterococcus) bacteremia
# Adenocarcinoma pancreaticobiliary origin
He presented with fever, jaundice, and mental status changes. 
RUQ US also showed persistent left intrahepatic biliary dilation 
and gallbladder sludge despite the presence of CBD stent, 
suggesting that the stent was non-functioning/occluded or there 
was some other source of obstruction. The CBD brushing cytology 
from his prior ERCP was non-diagnostic. He had no apparent mass 
in the head of the pancreas on imaging but there remained some 
concern for a primary pancreatobiliary tumor so he was planned 
to have a repeat ERCP and EUS the week he was admitted.
Blood culture at ___ is growing Strep spp. He was treated with 
Unasyn for cholangitis as well as Strep bacteremia. BCx here 
grew Strep anginosus. He had an ERCP on ___ with removal of the 
old stent and placement of a new stent over a 2cm 
malignant-appearing stricture of the distal CBD. Cytology 
brushings were sampled. EUS was completed on which they 
visualized a 1.8 x 1.1 cm ill-defined hypoechoic area around the 
distal CBD. FNB was performed x3. Pathology was consistent with 
adenocarcinoma.  
After the plastic stent placement, his LFTs did not improve and 
bilirubin continued to rise. A repeat ERCP was done on ___ with 
removal of the plastic stent and placement of a metal stent. 
After this, his LFTs started to improve. His Unasyn was changed 
to ceftriaxone and metronidazole for ease of dosing to complete 
a 2 week course ___ - ___. A PICC was placed prior to 
discharge. TTE did not show evidence of endocarditis.

# ___ on CKD
Cr peaked at 1.8 from baseline 1.2. Most likely this was 
prerenal in the setting of cholangitis. It improved after ERCP, 
antibiotics, and fluid resuscitation. 

# PVT
He was found to have a non-occlusive portal vein thrombus on 
MRCP during his recent hospital admission and was started on 
enoxaparin. HIs home enoxaparin was initially held for ERCP, 
then resumed. 

# Macrocytic anemia
Macrocytic anemia is chronic. Baseline H/H appears to be ___, 
so he is lower than baseline. He had no signs of bleeding.  
Recent TSH, folate, B12, ferritin, and TIBC were wnl. Bilirubin 
is predominantly direct, so less likely hemolysis. Other 
hemolysis labs were not consistent with hemolysis. Acute on 
chronic anemia is perhaps ___ bone marrow suppression from 
sepsis. He was given 1 unit pRBCs for Hgb 7.6. 

# Metastatic clear cell RCC on chemotherapy
He is followed at ___ by Dr. ___. He was diagnosed in 
___ in workup of gross hematuria and flank pain. He underwent a 
laparoscopic radical right nephrectomy in ___. He was found 
to have metastases to the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, and 
hilar lymph nodes in ___. In ___ he was enrolled in an 
experimental trial and started on sunatinib. His most recent CT 
showed clinical response. He is currently in his regularly
scheduled two weeks off on sunatinib. He had a surveillance CT 
on ___ which showed  no evidence of local recurrence of 
metastatic disease in the abdomen/pelvis. 

# LUL pneumonia
He was found to have LUL opacity on CT chest ordered for 
surveillance. He was also complaining of cough. He was on Unasyn 
while inpatient, then transitioned to ceftriaxone and 
metronidazole for 2 weeks total, which should cover him for 
pneumonia.

# HTN
Initially his home atenolol dose was halved due to concern for 
cholangitis/impending sepsis. His home amlodipine 10 mg and 
lisinopril 40 mg daily were also initially held. These were 
resumed prior to or at discharge. 

# Insulin-dependent DM type II
At home he takes glargine 16 units qhs if his FSBG is <170 and 
he takes 18 units qhs if his FBSG is >170. While inpatient, he 
was given glaring 8 units qhs as he was not taking much PO as 
well as lispro SSI. 

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# Hypothyroidism - continued home levothyroxine

# Depression and anxiety - continued home fluoxetine; held home
cariprazine as it is non-formulary

Mr. ___ is clinically stable for discharge. The total time 
spent today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination 
of care was greater than 30 minutes.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after you were found to have a 
blockage of your bile ducts causing a serious infection called 
cholangitis. You were also found to have bacteria in your blood 
stream.  You underwent an ERCP with a plastic stent placed. 
After the procedure your bilirubin continued to rise and you 
underwent a second ERCP to place a metal stent. 

For your serious infection you were started on IV antibiotics 
and will need to continue this for two weeks. 

This blockage in the bile duct was caused by a stricture. 
Samples of the stricture were taken and found to be cancer 
(adenocarcinoma). You were seen by the oncology team and have 
follow up with them in a few days to talk about treatment 
options. 

It was a pleasure caring for you,
Your ___ Team 
 
Followup Instructions:
