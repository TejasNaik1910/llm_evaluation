Imaging:
___ L HIP AND KNEE XRAY:
There is a subcapital fracture of the left proximal femur, with 
slight
superior displacement of the femoral shaft with respect to the 
femoral head. There is increased lucency along the superior edge 
of the femoral head adjacent to the fracture site and some 
ill-defined calcific material in this area. This could represent 
changes due to a subacute fracture. There is marked 
degenerativenarrowing of the left hip joint, with some lateral 
acetabular spurring.

Again noted is a partially imaged right total hip prosthesis, 
with some
surrounding acetabular lucency similar to ___. The pelvic 
girdle is
congruent. Probable ossification of iliolumbar ligaments. Clips 
noted over
prostate. Vascular calcification ipresent.
 
IMPRESSION - LEFT HIP: Left proximal femur subcapital fracture, 
with slight
superior displacement, possibly subacute. Severe left hip 
osteoarthritis.
 
LEFT KNEE: No true AP view was obtained. Both the frontal and 
lateral views
are obliqueD. There are mild degenerative changes, and probable
chondrocalcinosis. Dense vascular calcification. No obvious 
fracture, though a subtle proximal tibial insufficiency fracture 
would be difficult to exclude on these views.
IMPRESSION - LEFT KNEE: Limited exam. Doubt fracture. Please see 
comment.
.
___ CT PELVIS: Mildly displaced subcapital fracture of the 
left femur with 14 mm of anterior distraction and minimal 
posterior impaction. Tiny nondisplaced anterior acetabular chip 
fracture.  
2. Total hip arthroplasty on the right. 
3. Severe baseline osteoarthritis.  
.
___ ECG: rate 82, Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing.
.
___ left Tib Fib XRAY: 1. Possible stress fracture of the 
anteromedial tibial diaphysis. MRi is recommended for further 
evaluation as clinically indicated.  2. Degenerative changes. 
.
___ hip XRay: Single frontal view of the left hip 
demonstrates interval total hip arthroplasty with femoral and 
acetabular components in appropriate positions.  Expected 
post-operative changes are seen.
.
___ CXR: In comparison with study of ___, there is patchy 
opacification 
developing in the right cardiophrenic angle, worrisome for 
pneumonia given the clinical history. Remainder of the study is 
essentially unchanged. Prominent impression on the lower right 
side of the cervical trachea is again consistent with a thyroid 
mass. 
.
___ right tib/fib XRAY: There are no signs for fractures or 
dislocations. There are enthesophytes along the posterior aspect 
of the tibia and fibula due to the soleus attachment. 
Degenerative changes and spurring about the patella are seen. 
Enthesophytes at the anterior aspect of the patella are also 
present.  Proliferative changes along the medial malleolus are 
present. There are vascular calcifications. No definite lytic or 
sclerotic lesions are seen. If there is high concern for 
metastatic disease related to prostate cancer, would recommend 
bone scan.
.
___ hip bone pathology: pending.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old male with multiple right hip 
dislocations, parkinsons disease, CAD s/p multiple stents with 
history of in-stent thrombosis, atrial fibrillation on Pradaxa, 
h/o prostate cancer s/p radiation, admitted with left femoral 
neck fracture
.
#Atraumatic femur fracture: No preceding trauma raised the 
suspicion of a pathologic fracture. He has a history of prostate 
cancer but his PSA was undetectable and calcium was not 
elevated. Other cancer screening is up to date including clear 
___ colonoscopy and ___ sigmoidoscopy with the 
exception of changes in the rectum consistent with post-prostate 
XRT proctitis. ___ CT abd and pelvis was without signs 
of malignancy, only renal cysts. During admission, patient 
underwent a hemiarthroplasty without complications and no signs 
of bleeding. Pain was adequately controlled with dilaudid and 
standing tylenol and patient was transitioned to oral oxycodone. 
Pradaxa was initially stopped, patient was placed on heparin 
drip, s/p OR was on ppx lovenox for 48hours, and then was 
transitioned back to pradaxa for therapeutic anticoagulatoin. ___ 
worked with the patient after surgery, and patient was moving 
well without issues. Given the atraumatic fracture it was felt 
the patient should be treated for osteoporosis and Ca+ and 
Vitamin D were started for bone health with initiation of 
aledronate was deferred to outpatient PCP. Partial vitamin D 
repletion was performed with 50,000 units vitamin D x2 days. 
Outpatient hem-onc appointment was made with his oncologist for 
further outpatient work up of possible pathologic fracture and 
prostate cancer ___. Bone pathology was pending on discharge. 
Patient was scheduled with ortho follow up and ___ rehab 
has been notified of the appointment date and time.
.
#?possible tibial stress fracture: Patient complained of 
bilateral shin pain during admission. He has known 
osteoarthritis of his knees and associated chronic pain. 
Bilateral xrays of tib/fib were gotten and showed questionable 
stress fracture of left tibia. Per radiology, MRI recommended 
for further evalulation to better characterize this. No evidence 
of lytic or blastic lesions on xray, PSA<0.1. Ortho contacted, 
and stated that MRI would not change management or weight 
bearing status. Ortho-boot not indicated. Patient given 
lidocaine patch for the left knee/shin. This should be followed 
with further imaging/workup pending resolution or continuation 
of pain.
.
#Fever/Pneumonia: Patient had a fever the evening of surgery to 
101.0. An CXR was suggestive of pneumonia and patient was 
treated with levofloxacin for CAP given it occurred just 48 
hours after admission to hospital.  Will treat for CAP for 
levofloxacin 750mg PO qday for 7 days. Blood cultures NGTD on 
discharge.
.
#Depression: Patient is going through a difficult time at home 
with his wife recently diagnosed with terminal pancreatic 
cancer. He is bitter and demanding and appears to have some 
symptoms of depression. He is not interested in speaking to a 
psychiatrist as an outpatient and inpatient evaluation was not 
indicated. Denies SI/HI. Social work has seen the patient 
several times during the course of the admission. The stepson 
will continue to express concern to Mr. ___ and encourage him 
to seek out therapy or psychiatric evaluation, which patient 
would likely benefit from.
.
#CAD/Episodes of chest pain: Patient has significant CAD with 
multiple PCIs and history of in-stent thrombosis. He was 
continued on his statin, aspirin, and metoprolol. He did have 
some self resolving chest pain that was not related to exertion 
during his hospitalization. ECGs during these episodes were 
repeatedly unchanged and cardiac biomarkers were negative. 
Patient admits that he does take NTG intermittently at home for 
similar symptoms. Patient called Dr. ___ requested a 
cardiologist see him. Patient was seen by the Cardiology fellow 
who recommended increasing metoprolol to 50mg total daily. It 
was felt a stress test was not indicated and Cardiology signed 
off. Patient was given instructions to follow up with Dr. 
___ as previously scheduled.
.
#Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: CHADs2 score 4. Temporarily 
stopped pradaxa for OR, but restarted 48hours after surgery. Was 
on lovenox 40mg Qhs around the time of surgery. Increased 
metoprolol as well. There were no episodes of RVR.
.
#Chronic systolic CHF: Well compensated here. Denies furosemide 
though it is on his med list. PCP confirmed that patient is not 
on lasix. Last echo ___ with LVEF 35%. On ___, statin, 
pradaxa. Not on ACEI for unclear reason. Does have CKD but 
appears at his baseline.
.
#Chronic kidney disease: At his baseline. Renally dosed 
medications.
.
#Hypertension: Currently normotensive. Continued on metoprolol.
.  
#Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Only on glipizide at home. Last A1C 
in ___ was 5.8%. Maintained on HISS inhouse. 
.  
___ Disease:  Continued selegiline and 
carbidopa-levodopa.
.  
#Gout: Pt mentioned slight right ankle pain one morning on 
admission. Given home colchicine. Denied further pain.
.  
#Prostate cancer, T3b N0 M0, ___ 4+3 stage III: Completed 
___ years of hormonal therapy with Lupron. PSA ___ <0.1. Set 
up with outpatient heme-onc follow up given possible pathologic 
fracture.

Transitional Issues:
- PCP/Cards: Consider starting patient on ACEI for CHF. Please 
initiate aledronate therapy as patient has experienced a 
nontraumatic hip fracture. Calcium and vitamin D have been 
started. Patient has been instructed to schedule an appointment 
with you within a week of discharge from acute rehab. If patient 
amenable, consider antidepressants or referral to psychiatry.
- Bone pathology pending
- Blood cultures pending
- Patient has outpatient heme-onc follow up should his 
outpatient oncologist feel it necessary to further pursue 
malignant pathologic work up as cause for fracture.
- Ortho follow up appointment scheduled. Patient and acute rehab 
facility was notified of details.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. You were admitted for a fracture of 
your hip. You underwent a hemiarthroplasty by the orthopedic 
surgeons without any complications. Your pain is being managed 
with oral pain medications and will continue to improve as your 
hip heals. You were also found to have healing stress fracture 
of both of your shins, which should be managed with pain 
control.  It is very important for you to continue with physical 
therapy to aid with healing and building up your strength. You 
were additionally found to have a pneumonia (lung infection) and 
so you were started on levofloxacin, an antibiotic.

Please increase your metoprolol to 50mg daily. No other changes 
have been made to your home medications.

Please continue taking Levofloxacin 750mg tablet once daily for 
4 additional days to treat your pneumonia.

For pain control, please take:
Tylenol ___ by mouth every 6 hours for 1 week.
Oxycodone ___ tablets) every 4 hours as needed for pain

While on pain medications, it is important to take stool 
softeners to ensure you do not get constipated. Please take:
Docusate Sodium 100mg by mouth twice a day
Senna 1 tablet by mouth daily

Because you had a fracture of your hip, it is important that you 
start taking calcium and vitamin D to maintain your bone health. 
Please take:
Calcium 1250mg by mouth three times a day
Vitamin D 50,000units by mouth once a day for 3 days
Vitamin D 800units by mouth once a day, starting after taking 
three days at the increased dose of 50,000units.
Please also discuss with your primary care doctor starting ___ 
medication called alendronate, which is used in the treatment of
