History of Present Illness:
___ year old man with afib and recent GI bleed who presents with 
a left lower extremity pain. Today the patient was evaluated for 
a routine appointment with his cardiologist where he endorsed 
left lower extremity pain and was found to have a DVT by 
ultrasound. He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with 
symptomatic RVR in ___. He was placed on metoprolol 
and dabigitran at the time (CHADS 0, he was placed on 
anticoagulation due to a possible TIA given transient left sided 
leg weakness). He has not had symptomatic atrial fibrillation 
since starting metoprolol in ___. He then developed BRBPR 
along with some black/tarry stool 6 weeks ago. Denied abdominal 
pain, constipation/straining, or NSAID use prior to the 
bleeding. He saw his PCP who ___ hemorrhoid treatment, 
but the bleeding persisted (bloody stools occurred once daily). 
He was subsequently admitted to ___ for ongoing GI 
bleeding. During that hospitalization (4 days total), he 
received 4 units PRBCs, EGD, colonoscopy, and a failed capsule 
endoscopy (did not make it to small bowel). ___ showed mild 
distal esophagitis, hiatal hernia, single tiny possible early 
___ lesion and friability of the duodenal bulb. His 
dabigitran was stopped 2 weeks ago. He did not receive heparin 
SQ during his hospitalization that he can remember. He tried to 
walk frequently during that hospitalization. 6 days ago, he 
noticed the left lower extremity pain and swelling. He has never 
had a clot before, and denies a family history of VTE. He has 
been active since the hospitalization with exercise ___ 
(cardio/weights). Denies shortness of breath, chest pain, or 
palpitations. His last bloody bowel movement was 4 days ago.  
 
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.6 57 99/62 16 100%. Rectal exam 
guaiac negative. Labs notable for HCT 27, INR 1.0, and WBC 4.3 
with 9% eosinophils. Left ___ showed left gastroc vein DVT. He 
was started on a heparin drip at 20:40 at 1350 units/hour with 
no bolus. VS prior to transfer were: 98.1. HR: 61. BP: 97/63 
(patient reports lower BPs at baseline- active ___. O2: 97% RA. 
RR: 14.  
 
On arrival to the floor, he is comfortable and relayes his 
history clearly and consisely. He denies pain or discomfort. No 
SOB.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with afib (previously on 
dabigitran) and recent GI bleed with no source identified on 
endoscopy or colonoscopy from ___, who presented 
from clinic with a left lower extremity DVT and is now s/p IVC 
filter placement.  
 
# Left gastroc DVT: He was evaluated during a routine 
appointment with his cardiologist where  on review of systems he 
endorsed left lower extremity pain and was sent to the ED where 
he was found to have a left gastroc DVT by ultrasound.  It is 
unclear if unprovoked or provoked. During his recent 
hospitalization for GI bleed (below) he went without heparin SQ 
or DVT prophylaxis, but he was ambulating multiple times daily.  
In the ED was started on heparin drip. Given his recent GI bleed 
with unclear source, the decision was made to place an IVC 
filter as anticoagulation would put him at risk of continued 
bleed. IVC filter was placed on ___, and patient was set up 
with follow up with Dr. ___ will coordinate the 
removal of the filter in 3 months.  Because he was over ___ and 
this was his first clot and he has no FH of clots, a 
hypercoaguable workup was not done in the hospital. Our concern, 
however, is that he may have an irreversible etiology for his 
DVT, such as a malignancy, especially in the setting of this GI 
bleed. He was given instructions to follow up with his PCP who 
will provide a referral for hematology follow up with Dr. ___ 
___ or colleagues to further investigate a possible 
hypercoagulable state. 
   
# Recent GI bleed: Mr. ___ was recently admitted to 
___ for a GI bleed while on Pradaxa.  During that 
hospitalization (4 days total), he received 4 units PRBCs, EGD, 
colonoscopy, and a failed capsule endoscopy (did not make it to 
small bowel). ___ showed mild distal esophagitis, hiatal 
hernia, single tiny possible early ___ lesion and friability 
of the duodenal bulb. There was no obvious source of bleeding 
found.  His dabigitran was discontinued during that admission 
(approximately two weeks prior to current admission).  His last 
bloody bowel movement was 4 days prior to admission and he 
remained guaiac negative throughout hospitalization. Two large 
bore peripheral IVs were placed, an active type and screen was 
maintained and HCT was checked Q12H, which remained stable. He 
was started on iron at his prior hospitalization and that was 
continued.   
  
# Atrial fibrillation: He is currently in normal sinus rhythm 
without any perceptible episodes of afib since ___ 
when he was started on metoprolol. Metoprolow was continued 
during hospitalization with holding parameters.  His Pradaxa was 
discontinued on prior hospitalization, but there was ongoing 
discussion of anticoagulation risks/benefits (CHADS 0 vs 2 with 
? TIA) given this recent GI bleed.  Likely he should avoid 
dabigitran, but depending on the opinions of his outpatient 
gastroenterologist and cardiologist, his case may warrant trial 
of daily aspirin vs. coumadin in future. 
 
# CODE STATUS: FULL confirmed  
 
# EMERGENCY CONTACT: friend ___ (patient would like 
her to be his HCP although needs to fill out paperwork)  
 
# Transitional issues: 
- Patient was scheduled with follow up appointment with PCP to 
arrange referrals for hematology with Dr. ___ or 
colleagues for workup of ? unprovoked DVT, cardiology with Dr. 
___ IVC filter retrieval, and GI for possible 
re-scoping to find source of bleeding. 
- Patient will need IVC filter removal in 3 months from 
discharge (appointment scheduled with Dr. ___ in 1 month. 

- Patient will need cancer screening given possibly unprovoked 
DVT.
- Patient will need to discuss with PCP and cardiologist the 
need for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation going forward. 
He was dischared on no form of anticoagulation given recent 
bleed.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were found to have 
a clot in your leg (DVT). Because you had a recent GI bleed when 
you were on blood thinners (Pradaxa) for your atrial 
fibrillation, we placed a removable filter (IVC filter) in the 
vein leading to your heart to protect you from a clot entering 
the lungs (pulmonary embolus).  This filter is temporary and 
should be removed in 3 months.  You have expressed interest in 
transferring your cardiology care to the ___, so we set up a 
follow up appointment with a cardiologist here (below) who will 
remove the filter in the future and help decide whether or not 
you will need blood thinners in the future for your atrial 
fibrillation.  
 
We also reviewed the records from ___ from the 
gastroenterologists who performed the colonoscopy, endoscopy, 
and capsule study.  You should follow up with your PCP to get ___ 
referral for a GI appointment at the ___ so they can explore 
the possibility of additional studies to find the source of 
bleeding.  
 
You also have to get a referral from your PCP to get ___ follow up 
appointment for a hematologist here (Dr. ___ or 
colleagues) who will discuss possible blood testing to determine 
why you formed a clot in your leg. It is unclear why you formed 
a clot in your leg, this could be due to your recent 
hospitalization, but it could also be due to low level 
inflammation which could be from a variety of causes such as 
infection or a cancer. You could also be at a genetically higher 
risk of forming clots. 
 
It was a pleasure taking care of you. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
