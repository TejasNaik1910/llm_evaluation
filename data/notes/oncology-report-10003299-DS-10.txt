Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Throat Pain, confusion, worsening L hemiparesis 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ and biopsy 

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ w/ stage IIIA squamous cell carcinoma
of lung, s/p completion of concurrent ___ ___,
also w/ a h/o multiple strokes w/ residual left hemiparesis, 
HTN,
DL, and prior colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy who is transferred
from ___ for continuity of care. 

Dr ___, the oncology service resident, called me for
signout. She presented there  on ___ with subacute worsening 
of
her chronic L-sided hemiparesis and confusion. She was seen by
neurology and her head CT and brain MRI did not reveal any
new/acute stroke or other acute process. The neurologic symptoms
were therefore felt to be recrudescence of prior stroke symptoms
in the setting of dehydration, deconditioning, malnutrition. She
had a CXR that was concerning for pneumonia. She had a Chest CT
which revealed no pneumonia but did reveal b/l scapular mets. 
Her
confusion resolved with some maintenance fluids and her lue
weakness improved. Nutrition and ___ saw her as well. 

Her symptoms of poor po intake and esophagitis are known to her
oncology team and they have been working closely together,
respecting her wishes to remain independent at home. She was 
even
recently admitted ___ and her sx improved w/ oral liquid
lidocaine formulation. She states this helps and is not taking 
it
because she doesn't have it at home. 

I spoke w/ her daughter, who is her HCP and she noted that her
mom has been having increased confusion for weeks now at least.
She thinks she may have dementia. She notes that she does have a
new bottle of lidocaine at home. She notes worsening PO intake.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A complete 10-point review of systems was
performed and was negative unless otherwise noted in the HPI.
 
Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Briefly, patient initially presented to care in ___ with
hemoptysis. She was subsequently admitted for workup of same and
had a CT of the chest which showed a right infrahilar mass with
complete occlusion of the right middle lobe bronchus and
atelectasis of the right middle lobe with high suspicion for 
lung
cancer; there was evidence of bilateral intrathoracic 
adenopathy.
During her hospital admission, she was seen by the 
interventional
pulmonary team and scheduled for outpatient bronchoscopy.

She underwent bronchoscopy with EBUS under Dr. ___ care on
___. FNA of the right middle lobe mass showed findings
consistent with squamous cell carcinoma; there was biopsy-proven
involvement of the level 4L lymph node; sampling of the 11 L
lymph node showed no malignant cells.

Patient underwent staging PET scan on ___. This showed an 
FDG
avid 3.2 cm mass in the right infrahilar region with evidence of
occlusion of the right middle lobe bronchus and atelectasis of
the right middle lobe. FDG avid subcarinal adenopathy measuring
up to 1.3 cm was noted; additionally enlarged mediastinal and 
and
hilar lymph nodes are also noted.  A 2.2 cm left lower lobe
subpleural FDG avid lesion was also noted. No other distant
metastatic sites of disease were noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
=========
___ w/ stage IIIA squamous cell carcinoma of lung, s/p 
completion of concurrent ___ ___, also w/ a h/o 
multiple strokes w/ residual left hemiparesis, HTN, DL, and 
prior colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy who is transferred from 
___ for continuity of care after presenting 
there w/ confusion and worsening LUE weakness. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
============
#Odynophagia/Dysphagia: Most likely radiation esophagitis, 
reflux esophagitis. ___ EGD with esophagitis, gastritis, 
duodenitis. Gastric biopsy showed H. pylori. She was given 
viscous lidocaine with meals, BID PPI, fluids as needed, and a 
regular diet. We had long discussions about her goals of care 
with both her outpatient oncology team as well as her palliative 
care team (detailed below) and it was ultimately decided to not 
pursue full antibiotic therapy for H. pylori as her primary 
symptom of odynophagia is most likely primarily related to 
strictures and radiation esophagitis. 

#Failure to thrive
Seems like most likely etiology is poor po intake. Felt to be 
due to progressive esophagitis (presumably radiation induced). 
She has odynophagia. TSH wnl. No e/o pulmonary infection. UA neg 
at OSH. C diff negative this admission. Geriatrics was involved 
in the patient's care during this admission. Her throat and body 
pain was controlled with IV morphine, and she received viscous 
lidocaine to help her eat/drink more comfortably. She was 
supported with IVF as needed. ___ and OT evaluated her and 
recommended rehab placement however after long discussions of 
her GOC and it was decided that she would not want tube feeding 
and would like to go home on hospice. 

#Nonocclusive thrombus in right IJ
In the setting of being hypercoagulable from malignancy. 
HAS-BLED score is 3 (HTN, stroke Hx, age she is at high risk for 
major bleeding, but is hypercogulable iso malignancy. The 
definitive treatment for her hypercoagulable state is treatment 
of her malignancy, if within GOC. Her home ASA/Plavix were 
continued, and she was started on enoxaparin 80 mg SC daily, 
with the plan to treat for 1 month.

#Stage IIIA Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma
#Bilateral lytic scapular lesions
Most recent imaging, CT chest on ___, revealed substantial 
decrease in size of the pre-existing right hilar mass, which now 
measures 20 x 20 mm in diameter. However CT abd revealed "new 
1.3 cm hepatic segment VII lesion ... suspicious for 
metastasis." ___ elevated this admission, consistent with liver 
involvement. Now CT from ___ revealed new bilateral lytic 
scapular lesions.
Outpatient team arranging PET scan in ___, with future 
cancer treatment directed therapies to be determined. Her 
outpatient oncology team (Drs ___ was contacted 
with updates. Hip/femur x-rays were obtained to eval for 
osseous/lytic lesions (because of delays with scheduling a bone 
scan).

#Encephalopathy 
She's been having episodes of confusion for some time now per 
daughter. She locked herself in the bathroom last week. 
"Thetiles have me locked in the bathroom and I can't get out." 
But the bathroom was not locked. A few weeks ago, she had left 
the stove on during a hot day, and she stated she was heating 
food for her son (who was murdered ___. Daughter is 
concerned
about dementia. MRI brain did not reveal mets or new stroke. 
although pt is oriented x 3, she seems to have poor insight into 
reason for admission and her hospitalization. Confusion possibly 
also due to impaired sleep (sleeps during day, as lives with her 
son who works nights), dehydration, pain from malignancy. 
Geriatrics was consulted and assisted with her care. Her 
nutrition and hydration status were optimized and her pain was 
controlled with IV morphine. She received high dose thiamine for 
possible Wernicke's encephalopathy. She received folic acid 
repletion for severe protein calorie malnutrition.

CHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES:
========================
#Worsening LUE and LLE weakness - stable
#History of CVA w/ residual hemiparesis
Likely recrudescence from prior CVA and improved w/ hydration 
and nutrition. Her home aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin were 
continued. Her neurologic status was checked daily. She was 
started on Lovenox ___aily.

#Severe protein calorie malnutrition: 
- Nutrition was consulted. She received a regular diet, high 
dose thiamine, folic acid and MVI. Her electrolytes were 
monitored daily and repleted as needed.

#Tobacco Abuse: Continued nicotine patch.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Due to esophageal spasms seen during EGD, outpatient 
esophageal mannometry should be considered to further work up 
her dysphagia/odynophagia.
[] Consider starting a bisphosphonate, if osseous metastases are 
confirmed through bone scan/bone biopsy.

Code status: DNR/DNI

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You were having pain in your throat and body. You were not 
getting enough to eat and drink. Because of this, you were 
weaker than usual, which made your old stroke symptoms seem 
worse. Your children were concerned that you were more confused 
than usual.

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You received scans to make sure that you did not have a new 
stroke.
- You were watched closely for signs of infection.
- You were supported with fluids and nutritious food.
- You underwent an endoscopy procedure, which showed a lot of 
inflammation that is probably causing your swallowing pain. You 
were given liquid lidocaine for throat pain, as well as an acid 
blocker medicine. 
- Your body pain was treated with morphine.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- Continue to take all your medicines and keep your 
appointments.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team
