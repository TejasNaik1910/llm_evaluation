Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: PER OMR
- ___: Evaluated by PCP ___ ?umbilical hernia and GI
distress. On exam, there was no mass that was able to be
palpated, so an ultrasound
was recommended.
- ___: The ultrasound showed a 2.9 x 2.3 cm solid
well-circumscribed mass in the posterior abdomen versus
retroperitoneum versus pancreatic head with adjacent adenopathy. 

She then underwent an abdominal CT on ___ which
demonstrated a 2.8 cm mass in the pancreas uncinate process
suspicious for carcinoma.  
- ___: She underwent an endoscopic ultrasound showed a 30 
x
30 mm ill-defined mass in the head of the pancreas. The mass was
hypoechoic and heterogeneous in texture.  The borders were
irregular and poorly defined.  Both an FNA and FNB were
performed, but unfortunately they were nondiagnostic withscant
parenchymal sampling, stromal fibrosis and atypical ductal cells
seen.  The initial ultrasound showed that the celiac artery
takeoff and superior mesenteric artery takeoff were not invaded
by the mass.  The mass also did not seem to involve the portal
vein or a portosplenic confluence; however, it was in close
proximity to the SMV, though there was an intact interface noted
at all levels.  
- ___: She returned for a second endoscopic ultrasound
on ___ and this time pathology from this biopsy showed
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated. 
Cytology was also suspicious for malignancy.  
- ___: She saw Dr. ___ and ___ recommended
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and CyberKnife. 
- ___: C1D1 FOLFIRINOX
- ___: C2D1 FOLFIRINOX
- ___: C3D1 FOLFIRINOX

Pertinent Results:
PERTINENT IMAGING:
___ Imaging CTA ABD & PELVIS 
1. No evidence of acute intra-abdominal process. 
2. Unchanged appearance of hypo attenuating uncinate process 
pancreatic mass 
with encasement of an early branch of the SMA.  No abnormal 
bowel wall 
enhancement or pneumatosis. 
3. Right lower lobe areas of ___ opacity suggesting 
either aspiration 
or early infection. 
___ Imaging GASTRIC EMPTYING STUDY 
FINDINGS:  Residual tracer activity in the stomach is as 
follows: 
  
At 45 mins 99% of the ingested activity remains in the stomach 
At 2 hours 93% of the ingested activity remains in the stomach 
At 3 hours 86% of the ingested activity remains in the stomach 
At 4 hours 77% of the ingested activity remains in the stomach 
  
The emptying curve demonstrates a plateau for the first 45 
minutes followed by 
markedly slow emptying for the remainder of the exam.  No reflux 
to the 
esophagus. 

IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal gastric emptying study with the 
majority of 
activity remaining in the stomach. 
  

___ Imaging CHEST (PA & LAT) 
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The hila are 
normal.  There is a large region of heterogeneous opacity 
extending from the mid lower to upper lung zone likely 
representing pneumonia.  No pleural abnormalities.  No  
pneumothorax.  The visualized bones and soft tissues are normal. 
 The right port is in satisfactory position. 

___BD & PELVIS WITH CO 
1. No significant interval changes in an uncinate process 
pancreatic lesion encasing and occluding an early branch of the 
SMA.  No abnormal wall enhancement noted. 
2. Significant amount of residual dense oral contrast in the 
rectum and sigmoid colon since last study raises concern for 
barium impaction. 
3. Persistent ___ nodules in the right lower and right 
middle lobes are likely due to aspiration. 
4. Unchanged 5 mm left lower lobe lung nodule should be 
reassessed at the time of the follow-up. 

___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
Compared to chest radiographs ___ and ___. 
Heterogeneous peribronchial opacification in the right lung has 
improved 
consistent with decreasing pneumonia.  Left lung clear.  No 
pleural 
abnormality.  Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Right 
transjugular central venous infusion catheter ends in the low 
SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION:
___ w/ locally advanced pancreatic cancer (s/p XRT, on 
FOLFIRINOX
f/b neulasta), upcoming whipple scheduled ___, who p/w 2 weeks
of persistent nausea and abdominal pain. 

ACUTE PROBLEMS:
# Nausea/Vomiting/Abdominal Pain
# Gastroparesis
# Fever
Etiology initially thought related to chemo (given symptoms 
started shortly after FOLFIRNOX prior to admission). CT scan 
unremarkable. Initially improved with Ativan, Zofran, Zyprexa. 
Underwent celiac nerve block on ___. Symptoms recurred on ___, 
the day of most recent FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. That same day, 
also had a markedly positive gastric emptying study. She was 
started on metoclopramide on ___ and erythromycin on ___ with 
good response. Erythromycin was discontinued on ___nd prevent tachyphlyaxis. Of note, her Abilify was 
discontinued as it
interacts with the metoclopramide. Other interventions included 
increasing home oxycontin to 20mg twice daily, fosprepitent with 
chemotherapy D1, added Creon to meals, added bid PPI in place of 
H2 blocker, and increased bowel regimen.

Despite this, patient continued to have significant nausea and 
vomiting with meals. Patient developed a fever on ___, and CT 
abdomen/pelvis on ___ revealed oral barium impaction. Patient 
underwent enema that night with output of ___ barium contrast 
and solid stool. Patient's nausea and vomiting improved 
significantly, but continued to have marked abdominal pain. She 
did not have another bowel movement for the next two days, aso 
underwent additional enema on ___, again with good output. 
Shortly following second enema, patient did develop feelings of 
presyncope and SBP's in the low 80's. Infectious and cardiac 
workup was unremarkable, and patient responded quite well to 
1.5L NS. Etiology thought due to hypovolemia and vagal 
stimulation from enema. By day of discharge, patient felt well 
without nausea or vomiting, and significant improvement in her 
chronic abdominal pain, which was well controlled with oral pain 
medications.  Notably, fever on ___ thought due to aspiration, 
as it resolved quickly without sigficant leukocytosis or 
antibiotics and resolving infiltrate on repeat CXR.

# Pancreatic Cancer
Locally advanced and has demonstrated a favorable response to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Plan to continue chemo when n/v and 
abdominal pain improve and patient plans for ___ on ___. 
C6D1 Folfirinox was given on ___ with neulasta on ___. 
C6D15 FOLFIRINOX was held, and after discussion with patient's 
primary oncologist, she will not undergo additional 
chemotherapy. She will follow up with her outpatient oncologist 
and with her surgeon, Dr. ___, in preparation for Whipple 
surgery at the end of this month.

# Depression/Anxiety
Symptoms were largely stable during admisison. Abilify was 
stopped due to interaction with metoclopramide. Patient should 
follow up with her outpatient psychiatry providers. We continued 
her trazodone, pregabalin, lamotrigine, and clonazepam. QTC was 
monitored weekly, last was 400msec ___. (on admit QTC was 
420msec)

# Hypokalemia: Likely due to N/V and chemotherapy. Resolved w/ 
repletion.

CHRONIC PROBLEMS
# Borderline Macrocytic Anemia: stable, ___ antineoplastic 
therapy
# Thrombocytopenia: stable, ___ antineoplastic therapy, improved
# GERD: Switched to bid omeprazole, and tums prn

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Maintain aggressive bowel regimen to prevent 
constipation/obstipation
- Monitor QTc intermittently while on standing metoclopramide, 
would suggest doing this every ___ for the next ___ weeks
- Adjust pain medications as needed
- Follow up with surgery on ___ for planning of Whipple s/p 
neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX

enemas to help clear out the impaction. Afterward, your symptoms 
significantly improved. You received your last dose of 
chemotherapy on ___ (we held the ___ dose). You will follow up 
with your primary care doctor and with Dr. ___ as below
