Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE 
================================= 
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman w/ history of CLL (on venetoclax), 
depression with psychotic features, GERD, single remote episode 
of pancreatitis, IDDM, CAD s/p PCI, roux-en-y gastric bypass & 
cholecystectomy, & hypothyroidism who presented with acute 
onset, severe epigastric pain. CTA A/P, lab work & cardiac 
workup were all unrevealing. Mr. ___ was evaluated by GI and 
underwent EGD, which revealed a healing jejunal ulcer as well as 
a ___ fistula. His home PPI was made BID and Mr. ___ 
was provided with low dose oxycodone prn for pain management. 
Course was complicated by periods of lethargy and delirium. His 
levothyroxine was titrated up as his recent TSH was elevated and 
concern this was contributing to his lethargy. Mr. ___ was also 
seen by psychiatry, who assisted in medication adjustments. Over 
the course of his hospitalization, Mr. ___ mental status 
waxed and waned, likely due to his underlying medical issues and 
medication titration, however at discharge his mental status was 
back to baseline and clear. Course was further complicated by 
___, that was deemed contrast induced nephropathy. Mr. ___ was 
seen by renal, and upon discharge his Cr was 1.1. Mr. ___ was 
followed by ___ throughout his hospitalization for assistance 
in managing his IDDM.
