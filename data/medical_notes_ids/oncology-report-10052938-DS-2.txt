History of Present Illness:
___ year old Female from ___ here for ERCP, due to 
bile duct obstruction from invasive metastatic 
cholangiocarcinoma. The patient had resection of the tumor with

admission she presented to ___ with fever, hypotension, 
bilirubin of 3.7 and ultimately had positive blood cultures with 
gram negative rods. Sent over for restenting via ERCP here at 
___ initially planned as round-trip. However ERCP failed due 
to inability to pass the wire past the tumor which has grown 
through the stent. 

She is now admitted to ___ does not have an ___ service that can 
do a PTBD placement in this acutely ill a patient. On arrival to 
the floor she presents hypotensive. Prior to transfer she was

rigoring with a Tmax 102.4.

The patient was initially diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma in 
___. 2 weeks prior to this admission she was admitted to ___ 
with 2 weeks of abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting,, elevated

On this presentation to ___ she presents with fever, 
nausea/vomiting and RUQ pain. She also notes worsened cough 
productive of white sputum. Initial vitals there were T102.4, HR 
140s, BP 91/59. An initial CXR concerning for possible LLL

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a history of metastatic cholangiocarcinoma who 
presented with hypotension, fevers, chills, found to have 
cholangitis with GNR and group D strep bacteremia in the setting 
of biliary duct obstruction, now s/p ___ guided perc biliary 
drain placement.

# Gram Negative Sepsis due to Cholangitis
# Cholangiocarcinoma metastatic to liver/Lung
# Bacteremia:
Hx of cholangiocarcinoma, s/p extrahepatic biliary tree 
resection with hepaticoduodenostomy at ___ in late ___. Had 
recent admission for abdominal pain, ultimately found to have 
imaging findings consistent with progression of 
cholangiocarcinoma.
She re-presented to ___ and was found to have likely 
cholangitis.
Blood cultures grew E.Coli (sensitive to cefepime) and Group D 
Strep species. Re-presented to ___. She was transferred to ___ 
for ERCP. Had failed ERCP done ___: GI unable to gain access to 
proximal biliary tree as prior stent clogged with tumor
ingrowth. She underwent ___ percutaneous biliary drain 
placement with ___.
TTE was obtained given group D strep bacteremia and was negative 
for vegetations. ID did not feel that TEE was necessary, given 
known source of infection and rapid clearance of blood cultures.
She was initially treated with vanc/cefepime/flagyl, and 
transitioned to levofloxacin/flagyl at discharge per ID 
recommendations. She will require a two week total antibiotic 
course for bacteremia (day 14 = ___.
Drains were capped by ___ prior to discharge. She will require ___ 
follow up in four weeks for cholangiocarcinoma and possible 
stenting.

# Hypotension: secondary to sepsis. Required brief ICU stay post 
drain placement. She received 1L of IV fluid with resolution of 
hypotension. Home anti-hypertensives were initially held. 
Metoprolol and torsemide were restarted prior to discharge. 
Continued to hold 2.5mg of lisinopril as blood pressures 
remained in the low-normal range 

# ? Pneumonia
CXR on ___ with patchy opacities (atelectasis v PNA). This was 
felt to be likely atelectasis due to splinting in the setting of 
abdominal pain. She did complete > 5 days of antibiotics as 
above which also covered for any concurrent pneumonia.

# Acute on Chronic Anemia (resolving)
Hgb on admission 7.4, decreased to 6.8 post-procedure.
Transfused 1 unit pRBCs with appropriate Hgb response to 9.1. 
She had no signs of active bleeding and Hg remained stable for 
remainder of hospital course

# Cholangiocarcinoma: metastatic, with progression on recent 
imaging. She will follow up with her outpatient oncologist next 
week for discussion of palliative chemotherapy vs. transition to 
hospice

#Transitional Issue
[ ] Subcentimeter pulmonary nodules which were not present on 
the previous exam. These are nonspecific, though metastatic 
disease is not excluded in this patient with cholangiocarcinoma. 
Further evaluation/follow-up per oncologic protocol. She will 
follow up with oncology as above, but per patient's sign plan is 
to likely decline chemotherapy

# Diabetes: held home metformin. Placed on ISS while 
hospitalized

# COPD (on 2L O2 at home, former smoker): continued home 
inhalers and 2L oxygen

# HFpEF
Hx of R side HF, not volume overloaded on exam. Restarted home 
torsemide after hypotension resolved.

> 30 minutes spent on discharge coordination and planning

Transitional Issues:
====================
- discharged on levofloxacin/flagyl for 14 day course for 
cholangitis/bacteremia (day ___ = ___
- needs ___ follow up in four weeks for cholangigram, discussion 
of possible stent
