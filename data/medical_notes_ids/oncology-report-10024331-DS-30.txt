IMAGING:
-___ CXR: IMPRESSION: Minimal blunting of the right 
costophrenic angle could be due to a trace pleural effusion 
versus pleural thickening. 
-___ CT Abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1. Possible mild rectal wall 
thickening, although evaluation is limited. 2. Renal hypodense 
lesions some which are consistent with cysts though several are

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old male with PMH prostate CA, radiation 
proctitis s/p argon laser treatment, AFib on pradaxa, CAD s/p 
multiple stent placements presents with BRPBR. In summary, Mr. 
___ was found to have findings c/w radiation proctitis on 
sigmoidoscopy which were treated with argon laser. He remained 
hemodynamically stable throughout admission and after 
sigmoidoscopy, and his bleeding stopped.
.  
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
#. Radiation proctitis: He remained hemodynamically stable with 
stable Hct's throughout his ED course and on the medical floor. 
He has a h/o sigmoidoscopy findings c/w radiation proctitis in 
___, s/p argon plasma coagulation. GI was consulted, and he was 
again found to have findings c/w radiation proctitis on 
sigmoidoscopy which were treated with argon plasma. He remained 
hemodynamically stable throughout admission and after 
sigmoidoscopy.
.  
#. Chest pain: He had a short episode of SSCP on ___, possibly 
in the setting of mild blood loss. He has a history of CAD s/p 
multiple percutaneous interventions. His repeat EKGs were 
unchanged from prior, with some nonspecific lateral ST changes. 
Three sets of troponins were negative.  
.
#. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: His EKG and telemetry 
demonstrated sinus rhythm throughout admission. He is on pradaxa 
for anticoagulation, but dfue to his bleeding risk and 
sigmoidoscopy preparation, his pradaxa was held for 2 days, but 
he was continued on his baby ASA, and pradaxa was restarted on 
the day of d/c. We continued his amiodarone but temporarily held 
his metoprolol given bleeding risk.
.
