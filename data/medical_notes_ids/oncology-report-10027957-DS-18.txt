Imaging
=======
___ CXR No acute intrathoracic process.
___ CTA Chest: 
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality.
2. Sub 5 mm right upper and lower lobe pulmonary nodules for 
which ___ year
followup chest CT is recommended if the patient is at high risk 
for lung
cancer.
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  ___ year followup chest CT the patient is at 
high risk for
lung cancer.
___ MRE
1.  Diffuse wall edema and hyperenhancement throughout the 
entire large bowel
is compatible with pan-colitis, similar in distribution and 
appearance to the
prior CT from ___.
2.  No evidence of focal inflammatory changes in the small 
bowel.

___ Sigmoidoscopy 
Impression:The rectum had a few aphthae but was relatively 
spared. The sigmoid had friability, extensive erythema, 
scattered aphtae, a few deep serpiginous ulcerations. Biopsies 
were taken in the sigmoid. (biopsy)
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to 20cm

___ MR Pelvis: 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Short branching transphincteric tract without a connection 
to the skin, as
described above.  No evidence of an abscess.
2.  Low signal in the perineum and anterior well of the internal 
sphincter
suggests scarring, possibly from prior trauma, such as a vaginal 
delivery, or
prior inflammation.  No active inflammation is identified in 
this region.
3.  Active Crohn's disease is again noted in the imaged portions 
of the large
bowel.  This was better assessed on the recent MR enterography.
4.  14 mm hemorrhagic cyst in the right ovary.  A follow-up 
pelvic ultrasound
is recommended in 6 weeks.
5.  Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Pelvic ultrasound in 6 weeks.

___ Colonoscopy 
Impression:Blood throughout the colon, most notably in the left 
colon, less so in the right colon. Diffuse ulceration and 
erythema from the sigmoid colon to the cecum. An ulcer with a 
visible vessel was seen in the right colon and successfully 
clipped. Underlying rectal mucosa was relatively spared.
Terminal ileum was intubated and mucosa appeared normal without 
blood.
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum

___ CXR 
No acute cardiopulmonary process seen.

___ CXR
Right PICC line tip terminates at the level of mid SVC.  Heart 
size and
mediastinum are stable.  There is questionable right lower lobe 
opacity
concerning for infectious process.  Alternatively it could be an 
atelectasis. 
Rest of the lungs are clear.  There is no pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
=======
___ history of Crohn's x ___ years c/b fistula/abscess on 10mg 
daily prednisone and infliximab admitted with one week of crampy 
abdominal pain, low grade fevers, multiple episodes of daily 
blood-streaked diarrhea concerning for Crohn's flare

ACUTE ISSUES: 
=========
#Crohn's flare: Patient presented with crampy abdominal pain and 
bloody diarrhea. Unclear trigger for current flare on admission. 
Prior to admission patient was on prednisone recently increased 
from 5 to 10mg) and infliximab. GI was consulted and patient was 
started on Augmentin per GI due to history of ___ 
abscess. Patient was initially treated with IV steroids, po 
augmentin, and bowel rest. Her bowel was imaged with an MRE 
which demonstrated pancolitis. Attempts to advance her diet 
resulted in bloody diarrhea requiring blood transfusion and 
which was concerning for persistent steroid refractory disease 
versus alternative bleeding source. Additional imaging was thus 
performed that demonstrated persistent disease despite treatment 
with IV steroids, po augmentin, and bowel rest. Patient was 
recommended to undergo total colectomy but refused due to 
possibility of permanent ileostomy. She was amenable to IV 
cyclosporine and was treated with it from ___ before 
transitioning to po cyclosporine that was continued upon 
discharge. At the time of her discharge her IV methylprednisone 
was changed to po prednisone. During her hospital stay she was 
very briefly placed on TPN (___) due to her prolonged low 
dietary intake in the setting of bowel rest, but was able to 
advance to BRAT diet with IV cyclosporine initiation and was 
advised to advance her diet as tolerated at the time of 
discharge. Given the multiple immunosuppressing regimens the 
patient was on, she was also started on bactrim for PCP 
prophylaxis during this hospital stay which was continued at 
discharge. 

Unclear trigger for this flare, although pt reports more recent 
stress in setting of starting new BA 
-Pneumoboots + TEDs, previously counseled patient on importance 
of using SCDs and additionally encouraged ambulation during the 
day, particularly given her increased risk of thromboembolism 
due to Crohn's. Holding heparin in setting of patient refusal to 
heparin. 
-continue augmentin 
-per GI, avoid NSAIDs/narcotics as this may cause Crohn's to 
flare 
-per GI, ___ genotype and level results, pending 

#Lower extremity edema: Patient developed bilateral trace to 1+ 
lower extremity edema near the end of her hospital admission. 
While she is at increased risk of DVT given her Crohn's disease 
and given patient's refusal of heparin, DVT was felt to be lower 
on differential due to bilateral nature and the fact that the 
patient was ambulating and wearing ___ stockings. Swelling was 
thought to be due to IVF, high dose steroids, and holding home 
hctz in setting of prior diarrhea. 

#Anemia: Patient required 1u pRBC transfusion on ___ and 
required 3U PRBCs on ___ with appropriate response in 
hemoglobin. 

___: On admission creatinine was elevated to 1.2 from baseline 
of 0.7. Cr returned to baseline with IVF. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
===========
#HTN: Home HCTZ was held in the setting of diarrhea.
  
#Thrush: Continued nystatin swish/swallow  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
===================
#) Crohn's flare: Pt. to continue on prednisone 40mg for 1 week. 
Dose will decrease by 10mg/weekly. GI to guide taper. Pt. to 
continue neoral 200mg PO BID. Pt. to hold infliximab.
#) Outpt Labs: Will require CBC, Chem 10, LFTs, cyclosporine 
level. These should be done in the morning, PRIOR to AM 
cyclosporine dose, on ___. 
#Future Labs: Pt. to have CBC, Chem 10, LFTs, and trough AM 
cyclosporine level prior to AM dose twice weekly starting 
___.
#) PCP ___: Patient started on Bactrim for PCP 
prophylaxis given ongoing cyclosporin 
#) Nutrition: Advanced as tolerated per GI. 
#) HTN: BP 130/70 on day of discharge. Home hctz was held due to 
diarrhea on presentation. Please follow up electrolytes as 
outpatient and restart as clinically warranted. 
#) Lower extremity edema: Patient developed 1+ bilateral ___ 
edema in setting of holding hctz and IV steroids per above. 
Please follow up and adjust medications as clinically warranted. 


#) *****Pulmonary nodules: CTA performed in ED due to initial 
concern for PE and positive D-dimer. No evidence of PE noted. 
However, incidental finding of sub 5 mm right upper and lower 
lobe pulmonary nodules for which ___ year follow-up chest CT is 
recommended if the patient is at high risk for lung cancer.***
#) ***** Pelvic ultrasound: On MR pelvis ___, a 14 mm 
hemorrhagic cyst was noted in the right ovary.  A follow-up 
pelvic ultrasoundis recommended in 6 weeks *******
