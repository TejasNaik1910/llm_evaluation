INTERVAL STUDIES & IMAGING:
=
================================================================
___ ECG
Sinus rhythm. Respiratory variation in QRS morphology. Compared 
to the 
previous tracing of ___ the rate is slower. Computed QRS 
duration is 
slightly narrower. Q waves are no longer seen in leads III and 
aVF arguing against prior myocardial infarction. Previously 
described non-specific repolarization abnormalities have 
improved with taller T wave amplitudes throughout.  

___ COLONOSCOPY
Findings:  
 Protruding Lesions A circumferential mildly bleeding 5 cm mass 
was found in the sigmoid colon at around 25cm. The scope could 
not traverse the lesion and the examination was interrupted. 
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the 
sigmoid mass.  
Impression: Mass in the sigmoid colon (biopsy)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to sigmoid colon 
Recommendations: - Differential diagnosis includes neoplastic, 
ischemic, or inflammatory process which explains patient's 
hematochezia. Most likely and concerning diagnosis is 
malignancy. 
- Recommend CT torso and CEA for staging
- Pathology results will be rushed and patient informed as soon 
as they become available
- Follow-up with inpatient Liver team 

___ CT ABDOMEN + PELVIS
1. Interval development of a lobulated fluid collection inferior 
to the inflamed gallbladder consistent with perforated 
cholecystitis, with gallstones layering within the collection. 
2. Approximately 2.5-3 cm partly circumferential mass in the 
sigmoid colon consistent with the reported malignancy. Lymph 
nodes in the adjacent mesocolon do not meet CT criteria for 
pathologic enlargement and mesenteric stranding is nonspecific. 
No definite evidence of metastatic disease in the abdomen or 
pelvis. 
3. Re- demonstration of 1.5 cm lesion in hepatic segment 7, 
better depicted on previous MRI, but with probable observation 
of washout on today's study. This remains suspicious for ___ 
although today's examination does not meet criteria to assess 
OPTN features. 
4. 7 mm nodularity of the right adrenal gland, which might 
represent a tiny adenoma, is stable. Nonenhancing possible 
chronic hematoma inferior to the right adrenal gland is also 
stable. 
5. Stranding along the inferior mesenteric artery distribution. 
Given thickwalled appearance of the inferior mesenteric artery, 
superimposed vasculitis is not excluded. 

___ CT CHEST
1. Moderate to severe centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema. No 
metastatic lesions within the lungs.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo M, ___ 
speaking, with history of HBV/HCV cirrhosis (c/b grade 1 
esophageal varices, and ___ s/p resection ___, now presenting 
with painless BRBPR. 

Active issues. 
# Ruptured gallbladder: The patient presented for a recent 
hospitalization (___) where he was found to have 
cholecystitis. He was managed medically with a 14 day course of 
ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. While in house for this current 
admission (CC: ___, he underwent colonscopy, where he was 
discovered to have a sigmoid mass. He underwent CT imaging of 
the torso for staging, given his new sigmoid adenocarcinoma, and 
was incidentally found to have a perforated gallbladder (see 
IMAGING reports above). He complained of ___ pain in the RUQ 
and remained hemodynamically stable, with a rather benign 
abdominal exam, and afebrile. He is s/p PTBD on ___, with 
tube in place, draining well. The patient will retain the PTBD 
for decompression and plan for an interval cholecystectomy with 
Dr. ___. Continue ciprofloxacin 500mg BID, Flagyl 500mg q8h 
until seen by Dr. ___ as outpatient.

# Sigmoid colon mass: on colonoscopy yesterday, a partially 
obstructing, circumferential mass was identified in the sigmoid 
colon. Hemoglobin is stable and within normal limits (14.3 
mg/dL). Staging torso scan showed no evidence of pulmonary or 
intra-abdominal metastases. Pathology report of the mass biopsy 
is consistent with adenocarcinoma. At this point, the patient is 
still having bowel movements and has a non-distended abdomen; 
therefore he does not appear to be clinically obstructed. The 
patient is OK to have a regular diet, but was educated about 
warning signs of obstruction. It is planned that is to have an 
interval laparoscopic resection of the mass and interval 
management of the perforated gallbladder as well. 

# HBV/HCV cirrhosis:  history of decompensated cirrhosis in the 
setting of upper GI bleed. Currently, MELD 9, ___ class A 
cirrhosis. No thrombocytopenia, mild elevation of INR to 1.3. 
Continued home tenofovir for HBV and propranolol for variceal 
hemorrhage prophylaxis.

# Dizziness: the patient reported dizziness, that was improved 
when sitting. He did not endorse any signs/symptoms of vertigo. 
His orthostatic vital signs were negative. He denied headache, 
difficulty hearing, otorrhea or instability. He had no focal 
neurologic findings. His dizziness/lightheadedness was 
attributed to fluid status, infection and concomittant use of 
antibiotics. 

Inactive issues.
# LGIB: Resolved. He remained hemodynamically stable and found 
on admission to have H/H ___ mg/dL range), which is above his 
baseline without coagulopathy. He did not require any 
transfusion of blood products or fluid resuscitation while in 
house. The etiology of the LGIB was determined to be the sigmoid 
adenocarcinoma. 

# HCC: He has history of ___ s/p excision in ___ in ___, now 
with suspicious 1.8cm lesion seen on repeat liver MRI; this will 
need to be followed in the outpatient ___ clinic.
- Outpatient hepatology follow up 

# HTN: Currently normotensive, so holding home antihypertensives 
other than propanolol. Given reports of dizziness, propranolol 
was held, withotu change in his dizziness. His orthostatic vital 
signs were negative and he appeared well hydrated. 

# Portal Hypertensive Gastropathy: discovered on EGD in early 
___. Currently managed on propranolol. Plan for 3 month 
interval EGD to follow up. Outpatient hepatology follow up in 
___ for EGD and evaluation of PHG.

****TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:*****
- He will continue on cipro 500mg BID, flagyl 500mg q8h (D1 ABX 
___ - originally planned for 14 day course, however 
continued given GB rupture & PTBD placement 
- He will need outpatient management for laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy after completion of his antibiotic course
- He will need outpatient management for laparoscopic resection 
of his sigmoid cancer
- He has history of ___ s/p excision, now with suspicious 1.8cm 
lesion seen on repeat liver MRI; this will need to be followed 
in the outpatient ___ clinic.
