Chief Complaint:
CC - bile duct obstruction, s/p ERCP

s/p ERCP ___ with sphincterotomy
 
History of Present Illness:
HPI - This is an ___ y/o female with a PMH significant for HTN, 
Afib s/p PPM, presenting for admission after an ERCP, performed 
for biliary dilitation seen on CT scan.  She has had epigastric 
pain for ___ years, crampy in nature with radiation to her back.  
This pain is occasionally related to eating, but not always.  No 
n/v/diarrhea with the pain.  No f/c/s or jaundice.  No weight 
loss or changes.  She was recently started on a statin and 
routine LFT check demonstrated transaminitis and 
hyperbilirubinemia (values unknown).  In addition, CT scan done 
through her PCP for the abdominal pain demonstrated biliary 
dilation as well as distal CBD air with possible porta hepatis 
soft tissue density.  She was referred in for an ERCP.  She 
stopped her warfarin 7 days ago per ERCP instructions; she 
states her cardiologist is aware. 

ERCP today demonstrated severe stenosis of the major papilla.  
Sphincterotomy was performed.  CBD was unable to be cannulated 
despite multiple attempts.  

Patient is currently nauseous with 2 episodes of bilious 
vomiting.  No f/c/s, no abdominal pain.  No diarrhea.  No CP or 
SOB.  10-pt ROS otherwise negative in detail except for as noted

___ ERCP:
A severe stenosis of the major papilla was noted. Cannulation of 
CBD with sphincterotome was not successful despite extensive 
maneuvering.  A pre-cut sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 
o'clock position using a needle-knife. CBD was again not able to 
be cannulated.  
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was performed 
using a free-hand technique.  
Pancreas: The pancreatic duct was filled with contrast and well 
visualized throughout. The course and caliber of the duct are 
normal with no evidence of filling defects, masses, chronic 
pancreatitis or other abnormalities.  
Impression: Polyp in the stomach (biopsy)
Normal pancreatic duct
(cannulation)
Stenosis of the major papilla (sphincterotomy) 
Recommendations: Admit to Hospital
NPO overnight, keep well hydrated on IVF at discretion of 
primary team, diet may be advanced in the AM if pain free
Unasyn IV
CT pancreas protocol 

___ ERCP:
Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major 
papilla.  
Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a ___ 
catheter using a free-hand technique 
A single irregular stricture of malignant appearance that was 1 
cm long was seen at the hilum. 
There was moderate pre-obstructive dilation, especially in the 
left intrahepatic tree.   
An extension sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock 
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.  
Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush.  
A 5cm by ___ Double pigtail plastic biliary stent was placed 
successfully across the stricture with proximal end in the left 
intrahepatic tree and excellent drainage of bile and contrast 
noted. 
Recommendations: Pt will be transferred back to the floor under 
the care of the primary team 
NPO overnight, keep well hydrated on IVF at discretion of 
primary team, diet may be advanced in the AM if pain free 
Continue abx for 5 days 
Follow-up cytology results
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o female with HTN, afib, biliary obstruction (presented 
with chronic abd pain and new transaminitis) admitted s/p ERCP 
and attempted sphincterotomy for biliary obstruction; ___ 
attempt unsuccessful. Started on IV unasyn for empiric 
cholangitis and recommended to undergo CTA pancreas as there was 
suspicion for a mass causing the obstruction. CTA pancreas ___ 
showed suspicious hilar mass and biliary dilitation (?Klatskin's 
tumor).  Underwent repeat ERCP ___, with successful placement of 
plastic stent over obstruction and brushings sent for cytology.  
Second ERCP complicated by post-procedural chest pain, HTN, n/v, 
abdominal pain.  

Biliary obstruction - s/p ___ ERCP with placement of stent.  
Cytology obtained.  Symptoms improved but she did have some 
residual epigastric discomfort which was a ___ in severity.  
She tolerated a solid diet and was discharged home to continue 2 
additional days of augmentin and tramadol prn pain.  She will 
f/u with her PCP and is aware that cytology needs to be followed 
up with her PCP to determine if this lesion is in fact a 
malignancy.
