Mr. ___ first noted early satiety, bloating in ___.  His 
liver function tests were abnormal. Right upper quadrant 
ultrasound revealed a 7.3 x 6.4 x 9 cm mass in the right lobe of 
the liver, extending in to the left lobe. 

___, a biopsy was performed, which revealed a neuroendocrine 
carcinoma positive for CK7 and 20, chromogranins and 
synaptophysin and S-100.  In ___, a CT scan showed the mass 
was enlarging and causing biliary obstruction.  He had a 
negative octreotide scan at that time.  However, on ___ 
an AFP was over 3000.  On ___ he had an exploratory 
laparotomy and nodule biopsy along with intraoperative

progression on those therapies.

IMAGING
CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast ___ 
Large amount of pelvic ascites is present. The rectum and 
sigmoid colon appear grossly unremarkable. The bladder is also 
unremarkable. 
Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. 

IMPRESSION: 
1. Advanced infiltrate of hepatocellular carcinoma with probable 
occlusion of the right portal vein as described on previous CT. 
New interval increase in large volume ascites likely indicates 
disease progression. 
2. Diffuse hyperenhancement of the small and large bowel likely 
related to 
occlusion of the portal system. Lack of progression of oral 
contrast material beyond the stomach despite two-hour interval 
of administration. There is no definite obstruction as there are 
no dilated loops of small bowel or air-fluid levels. NG tube 
terminates within the stomach. 
3. No definite free intraperitoneal air. 
.
CXR ___ 
FINDINGS: The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar 
contours 
are normal. There is no subdiaphragmatic free air. The lungs are 
clear. The visualized osseous structures appear within normal 
limits. 
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of free air. 
.
KUB ___
No gross evidence of change. Contrast now in the colon thus no 
obstruction. No supine evidence of free air. 
.
EGD ___
Findings: 
Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 4 cords of grade II varices were 
seen in the lower third of the esophagus. The varices were not 
bleeding. 4 bands were successfully placed.  
Stomach:  Mucosa: Diffuse continuous erythema, congestion and 
mosaic appearance of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in 
the whole stomach. These findings are compatible with mild 
portal hypertensive gastropathy. Small ammout of dark blood was 
seen in the stomach.   
Duodenum:  Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.  
*Impression*: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus 
(ligation)
Erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach 
compatible with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy
-Normal mucosa in the duodenum
-Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 
.
------------------
CT Torso ___
CT Chest
Thyroid and thoracic inlet appear unremarkable. Paraseptal blebs 
are present. No discrete metastases of note. 
. 
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 
There is a massive confluent infiltrative hepatocellular 
carcinoma . This has substantially increased in size, and now 
involves the entire liver. Ascites is now present. This is a new 
finding. Focal areas of Ethiodol uptake are identified within 
the more central necrotic parts of this tumor. Aneurysmal 
dilatation of the left portal vein. Hepatic right portal vein 
appears occluded. The hepatic veins appear patent, although 
parts of the middle hepatic vein are grossly attenuated. 
Enlargement and recruitment of the hepatic artery is seen. There 
is infiltration into the anterior omentum, which may represent 
tumor spread. No definite metastatic disease is seen. 
. 
CT PELVIS  
Ascites as before. Prostate is normal. Bladder appears normal. 
Large and small bowel appear grossly unremarkable. 
. 
CT BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: 
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion. 
There are degenerative changes, possibly represent old trauma, 
along the right inferior pubic ramus.   
CONCLUSION: 
Massive disease progression with right portal vein and possibly 
middle hepatic veins are occluded. No definitive extra-hepatic 
spread. 
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# UGIB

Given his history of right portal vein thrombosis there is 
concern he may have back up of blood flow to the esophageal and 
gastric veins which may have ruptured and led to his UGIB.
- Pt transfused 6 units of pRBCs (Hct on presentation 16.7). He 
was also placed on octreotide gtt and PPI BID. GI performed EGD 
with banding of 4 cords of non-bleeding, grade II varices that 
were seen in the lower third of the esophagus. Carafate was 
begun with a plan for 5-day course. Repeat EGD in 2 weeks was 
recommended by GI. 
- After EGD pt was transferred from the ICU to the floor where 
his Hct was followed closely. Pt maintained stable Hct 
post-transfusion throughout hospitalization (Hct 31.0). 
- Pt was started on cipro ppx given UGIB and ascites. 
- AST/ALT slightly elevated above baseline, however his alk phos 
is lower and t/bili only slightly elevated when compared to b/l. 
Given these findings it is less likely he has developed a 
recurrent common hepatic duct stricture (s/p removal pigtail 
stent on ___.
.
# GPC in ED blood culture, ___ bottles
- possibly contaminant, however, pt was started on vancomycin 
while speciation and sensitivities were pending. Final culture 
revealed S. viridans.  Cultures were obtained prior to EGD and 
pt has no lines of concern for infection. Pt underwent Echo 
which showed no vegetations or signs of SBE.  Because all follow 
up cultures were negative and pt was afebrile and asymptomatic 
during his hospitalization the vancomycin was discontinued and 
he was startd on a two week course of clindamycin.
.
# Anion gap metabolic acidosis
Secondary to elevated lactate in setting UGIB with 
hypoperfussion. Resolved with blood products and IVF.
.
# Hypercalcemia
- On transfer to the floor pt was found to have elevated serum 
calcium (Ca ___, Alb 3.0).  Pt was started on continuous IVF 
and lasix. Pt responded well and had calcium of 9.1 on 
discharge.
.
# Liver cancer
- Patient off treatment since early ___.  Pt was not restarted 
on any chemotherapy during hospitalization.  ___ benefit from 
palliative care.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the ICU after you experienced upper GI 
bleeding requiring multiple units of blood. During the 
admission, an endoscopy was performed in which you had multiple 
blood vessels banded in your esophagus to try to stop the 
bleeding.  You tolerated the procedure well and were transferred 
out of the ICU.  We continued to watch your blood counts and 
monitor you for signs of repeat bleeding.  During your 
hospitalization you were found to have high calcium levels in 
your blood.  To lower the calcium we gave you IV fluids and IV 
medications.  When your calcium decreased to normal range and 
your blood counts were stable you were cleared for discharge.
.
We were also concerned about a possible infection in your blood, 
and so we did an ultrasound of your heart to make sure there was 
no infection there. The study showed no signs of any infection. 
However, we are sending you home with a 2 week course of an 
antibiotic called clindamycin.
.
There are several other new medicines you should take: the first 
is called Protonix (pantoprazole). You should take this pill 
twice per day, to prevent more bleeding. The next is called 
ciprofloxacin, another antibiotic. You only need to take this 
pill for 2 days. Another is called sucralfate, which you should 
take for 1 more day. Finally, we are giving you prescriptions 
for laxatives to help you move your bowels.
.
Please take all of your medicines as prescribed. Please follow 
up with you primary care physician within the next week to check 
your blood counts and your calcium level.  Please notify your 
physician or return to the emergency department in you have any 
return of blood in your stool or vomit.
