Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of 
metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with liver metastaasis, 
recent PE (___) and recent STEMI (___), prior ERCP metal 
PD and plastic stenting ___ ___. She has been hospitalized 
continuously at ___ for 3 weeks with originally admission 
to ___ in mid ___, with transfer to BI late in the ___ 
for GI bleeding and ERCP/stent placement. She was subsequently 
transferred back to ___ on ___ where she remained hospitalized 
until she was returned to ___ for management of acalculous 
cholecystitis. Her hospital course was notable for diagnosis of 
marantic endocarditis and acute right heart failure with 
anasarca and marked leukocytosis. After family meeting held 
___, the decision was made to transition to ___ focused 
care with transfer to ___ for hospice care.

#Goals of care: Ms. ___ was newly diagnosed with metastatic 
pancreatic cancer in ___ of this year with complications 
including hypercoaguability manifesting in bilateral PEs, 
marantic endocarditis, STEMI and superficial venous 
thromboembolism as well as acalculous cholecystitis, GI bleeding 
and anasarca. She has been in and out of the hospital since 
diagnosis with prolonged hospitalization on this presentation. 
She has been supported by her family (5 siblings) throughout her 
journey. On ___, we met at the bedside with Ms. ___, her 
sister and 3 of her brothers as well as the palliative care team 
and myself (hospitalist) to discuss her care and her goals 
moving forward. ___ was clear that she is at the end of life 
and understands her diagnosis is terminal. Her family expressed 
a desire to have her closer to home and to focus on comfort and 
___ agreed that this was her goal, to not be in a hospital 
setting. As such, the decision was made to transition toward a 
focus on comfort with discharge to hospice at ___. As I 
discussed with Ms. ___, we can continue oral abx for her 
acalculous cholecystitis and anticoagulation for her clots which 
can be stopped at whatever point she desires. Her family and the 
patient were comfortable with this plan. 

# Acalculous Cholecystitis: Patient admitted with severe RUQ 
abdominal pain and CT imaging concerning for acalculous 
cholecystitis. She was managed with IV narcotics and unasyn 
antibiotic therapy. Hepatobiliary surgery felt patient was not a 
surgical candidate, and ERCP felt intraluminal options were 
limited, so patient proceed with high risk PTC (as triple 
therapy could not safely be held, see below). Post-operatively, 
her abdominal pain symptoms initially improved dramataically, 
although she did experience transient drain site pain. Bile 
cultures grew Clostrium perfringens and GNRs. She was initially 
treated with broad abx which were narrowed to cipro/augmentin at 
discharge to continue at least through ___ or based on patient 
comfort. Drain will remain in place indefinitely for ongoing 
drainage of her gallbladder. 

# Marantic Endocarditis: 
# Pulmonary Embolism
# Intracardiac Mass:
# Right Superficial Venous Thrombosis: Patient's pre-hospital 
course had been marked by a constellation of multiple thrombobic 
events (STEMI, PE, DVT). TTE on admission (originally ordered to 
evaluate for persistence of previously seen intracardiac mass) 
notable for the development of extensive mitral valve 
thrombosis, concerning for marantic endocarditis. Platelets and 
fibrinogen were wnl, arguing against malignancy related chronic 
DIC. Vascular cardiology recommended anticoagulation be changed 
to lovenox. LENIS notable for superficial thrombosis. Serial TTE 
also noted increasing PASP, concerning for ongoing VTE/PE events 
causing CHF symptoms (below). Ms. ___ was discharged on 
lovenox once daily (1.5mg/kg daily). 

# Acute Right Sided Congestive Heart Failure
# Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
# Anasarca: Patient noted to have ___ edema on admission that 
appeared to worsen during her course likely related to fluids 
received while NPO, low albumin and elevated PASP on serial TTE 
(increased from 27-->52 this admission) suggesting ongoing 
VTE/CTEPH and subsequent right heart failure. She also had new 
hypoxia felt to be due to fluid though could be component of 
atypical infection based on CT read (afebrile). She was diuresed 
with some improvement. 

# Leukocytosis: Patient developed worsening leukocytosis after 
placement of perc chole tube. She underwent ERCP without e/o 
cholangitis though with evidence of necrotic tumor invading into 
duodenum. CT abdomen without source of infection. CT chest with 
likely pulmonary edema though cannot rule out infection. Cdiff 
sent and pending. ID consulted and felt that there was a 
possibility of suprainfection of one of her necrotic mets 
however given her high risk of bleeding and goals of care, 
further investigation of infection of her metastates was not 
deem in her goals of care. 

# Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: With liver metastasis found to 
have new splenic metastases while here. ___ oncologist: ___ 
___ was contacted and case discussed. She reported that 
patient was s/p folfirinox x1 cycle and then trialed briefly on 
gemcitabine however at this time is no longer a candidate for 
treatment. Palliative care was consulted and assisted with 
ongoing ___ conversation. As above, patient is being discharged 
to hospice.  

# Coronary Artery Disease
# Recent Inferior STEMI: Patient has PCI with BMS to RCA > 1 
month prior to admission, vascular cardiology recommended 
continuing clopidogrel, but stopping aspirin.

# Anemia
# GI Bleeding: EGD (___) ___ with oozing from superficial 
erosions in hiatal hernia and duodenum. Pt reports no bleeding 
since last transfer. ___ Hb with gradual downtrend from 8.8 
since ___. She received 1u pRBC on ___ with appropriate bump 
in hgb and no e/o bleeding on exam. 

# Depression: Continued home buproprion and sertraline. 
# GERD: Continued pantoprazole

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for management of an infection in 
your gallbladder. You had a tube placed in your gallbladder to 
drain your infection and were treated with antibiotics. 

Due to progression of your pancreatic cancer, you have decided 
to focus on your comfort. You are being transferred to ___ 
house which is a hospice house that specializes in managing 
symptoms related to advanced cancer. They will help manage your 
nausea, pain and confusion. 

You will continue to take blood thinners to prevent progression 
of your clots and antibiotics for your infection. You can stop 
these at any time if it becomes too difficult to take 
medications or if you decide you do not want additional 
injections. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you. We wish you all the best.
