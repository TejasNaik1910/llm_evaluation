Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with alcoholic hepatitis and pancreatitis in ___ 
found to have pseudocyst and transferred to ___ for EUS guided 
drainage.

#PANCREATIC PSEUDOCYST: She underwent MRCP and then was taken 
for endoscopic ultrasound guided cyst gastrostomy on ___ with 
aspiration of 4 liters of fluid and irrigation of adherent 
necrotic material attached to the wall of the cyst. 4 
double-pigtail stents were placed.  However, after the procedure 
she continued to have abdominal pain and developed a fever.  CT 
scan showed persistent extensive ___ fluid 
collections. She underwent repeat EUS guided drainage and 
removal of stents on ___.  This was followed by CT guided 
drain placement in the right flank fluid collection by ___ on 
___. TPN was continued on admission with oral dilaudid and MS 
___ for pain control. 
 
#PNEUMONIA: The patient developed fever to 102 on ___ following 
the EUS.  Although concerning for abdominal source CXR with 
pneumonia (and patient with cough x 3 days).  Vanc/Zosyn started 
to cover HCAP and abdominal infection to be completed ___, 
but these were resumed on ___ given ongoing infectious 
concerns.

#POSSIBLE PSEUDOCYST INFECTION, CANDIDAL INFECTION: Fluid 
culture from the drain placed in the right fluid collection grew 
___ albicans. Possible that relatively immune suppressed 
given history of ETOH use and cancer. She was given one dose of 
fluconazole but developed respiratory distress and rash 
concerning for drug reaction. Infectious disease was consulted. 
We opted for Micafungin IV coverage given the candidal infection 
of her pseudocyst material. Her case was discussed with 
___ who felt examination for endophthalmitis was not 
warranted in the absence of ocular symptoms.

#Depression: continued Cymbalta.  Social work consulted for 
assistance in coping with prolonged illness. 

#Diabetes, secondary to pancreatitis: Treated with insulin. 

#Breast Ca: Noted to have moderate height loss of T11 and 
pulmonary nodule on OSH imaging.  She states she has had chronic 
changes at T11 for a few years, known to her oncologist. No 
known history of pulmonary nodule.  Her tamoxifen was continued. 

-- NEEDS ONC F/U FOR OSH PULM NODULE

#Compression fracture: CT noting T11 subacute vertebral body 
compression fracture. 
--NEEDS ONC F/U

The patient was transferred to HPB Surgery Service on ___:

SURGERY DISCHARGE SUMMARY (___)
Ms. ___ was transferred to the ___ Surgical Service for 
further management. She was made NPO with IV fluids, and 
continued on IV Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Micafungin. 
Neuro: The patient received PO dilaudid with good effect and 
adequate pain control. When tolerating PO patient was 
transitioned to PO pain medication. Chronic pain service was 
consulted in order to optimize patient's pain control and their 
recommendations were followed. 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Cardiac Echo 
was obtained and demonstrated normal global and regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction, borderline right ventricular 
systolic function (see report for details). 
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GI/GU/FEN: Initially upon transfer patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids and TPN. On ___ a Dobhoff nasogastric tube was placed at 
the bedside, which was then advanced post-pyloric by radiology. 
Tube feeds were then initiated and titrated up to goal rate, 
which she tolerated. TPN was discontinued when tube feeds were 
at goal. She was also advanced to clear liquids which she 
tolerated. On ___ her 8French drain in the cyst was upsized by 
interventional radiology to a 20 ___ drain. Drain output was 
closely monitored. Patient's intake and output were closely 
monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  
Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when 
necessary.
ID: The patient's white blood count was monitored and continued 
to trend downward throughout her hospital course. The infectious 
disease service continued to follow. Vanc and Zosyn were 
discontinued on ___ per their recommendations after cyst 
cultures were positive only for budding yeast. On ___ her 
Micafungin was also discontinued due to the continued decreasing 
white blood cell count and the fact that her drain was putting 
out minimal purulent drainage. The patient remained afebrile 
with mild elevated WBC prior discharge. WBC will be continued to 
follow as outpatient. ID was contacted prior patient discharge, 
and ID agreed with the plan to discharge without antibiotics 
treatment. PICC line was removed prior discharge.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. Patient was 
discharged on sliding scale insulin.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required. 
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating TF at goal 
and clears, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was 
well controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.
