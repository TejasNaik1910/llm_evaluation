History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a ___ year-old female with a history of non-small 
cell lung carcinoma on study drug (protocol ___ Kinase 
inhibitor) since ___ who went for routine CT torso per study 
drug protocol and was found to have a right atrial tumor 
thrombus and right common iliac artery clot. Patient was called 
by her oncologist and advised to go to the nearest ED. She first 
went to ___ and was transferred to ___ since she 
gets most of her care here. In our ED, patient was continued on 
heparin gtt. Her initial vs were: T 98.1, HR 112, BP 115/75, R 
20, O2 sat 93% 4 L NC (baseline). Her exam was notable for a 
cool right lower extremity with dopplerable pulses, normal 
strength and sensation. Vascular surgery was consulted and 
recommended continuing the heparin gtt and monitoring her 
neurovasc status overnight but did not think intervention was 
necessary at this time given no symptoms and dopplerable pulses 
on the right foot. ___ was made aware of the patient and will see 
patient in the am unless condition changes. Currently, patient's 
vital signs on arrival to the ICU are P ___, BP 110/75, RR 24, 
O2 sat 93% 4 L NC. She reports that she did notice some pain in 
her right leg starting at the hip and radiating to her anterior 
thigh over the last week. She usually has cold feet and has not 
noticed one is more cold than the other. She denies dizziness, 
LH, HA or CP. She does have DOE but has not noticed any change 
from her baseline. She often coughs up blood-tinged sputum which 
has not changed. Denies abd pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, 
hematochezia, dysuria, difficulty ambulating, etc.

CT Torso W&W/O C Study Date of ___ 11:03 AM 
1. Sizeable filling defect in the left atrium, consistent with 
tumor 
thrombosis. Evidence of arterial thrombosis at the right common 
iliac artery. 
2. Stable, extensive and diffuse bilateral airspace 
consolidation consistent with the bronchoalveolar cell cancer. 
3. No abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. 
4. Interval resolution of the large right adnexal cyst. 
Stable-appearing 
small right adnexal cyst. 

___ PROCEDURE:  Flexible bronchoscopy.
 A full airway survey was
performed down to the subsegmental bronchi. There were no
evidence of endobronchial lesions or evidence of recent or
old bleeding. There were no blood clots noted. Therapeutic
aspiration of clear thin secretions was performed mainly in
the right lower lobe but also in the left upper lobe as well.
There were no purulent secretions noted. The flexible
bronchoscope was removed. The patient was transferred to the
postprocedure holding area in stable condition.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 3:27:22 ___ 
The left atrium is normal in size. A nonmobile globular mass 
(1.6 by 0.8 cm) is seen (in subcostal window only) projecting 
into the body of the left atrium. Its attachment site is not 
defined but may be in or around one of the right pulmonary 
veins. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%). Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral 
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. If clinically indicated, a transesophageal 
echocardiographic examination is recommended to more clearly 
define the apparent left atrial mass.
IMPRESSION: left atrial mass

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year-old female with a history of non-small cell 
lung cancer who presents with left atrial tumor thrombus and 
right common iliac clot admitted to the ICU for frequent neuro 
checks of cool extremity.  
.  
# Arterial thrombus: Patient has left atrial clot and right 
common iliac clot. She had a cool distal extremity on the right 
with dopplerable pulses. Vascular surgery consulted in the ED. 
The patient was admitted to the ICU for monitoring and then 
transferred to the OMED service. The patient was placed on a 
heparin drip and transitioned to lovenox prior to discharge.  No 
further intervention was made. 
.
# Lung cancer: The patient had known metastatic NSCLC. The 
patient was hypoxic but at her baseline home O2 requirement.  
She was continued on cough suppressants and albuterol as needed 
as well as vicodin for pain control.  She was discharged home 
with ___ services and instructed to follow-up with her 
hematologist.
.
# Hemoptysis:  Following initiation of heparin, the patient was 
noted to have blood tinged sputum. A bronchoscopy was performed 
which was without evidence of endotracheal bleed.  Her 
hematocrit was stable and her symptoms improved.  No further 
interventions were made.
.  
# Tachycardia: The patient was noted to be tachycardic on 
admission and this was felt to be due to her previously 
documented atrial thrombus and hypoxia.  EKG was normal and 
there was no JVD or muffled heart sounds to suggest tamponade. 
She was monitored on telemetry without any events.  Echo 
demonstrated the left atrial mass which appeared to originate 
from the pulmonary vessels.  CT surgery was aware of the patient 
and felt given the extent of her disease, surgical intervention 
would not be of benefit.  The patient was stable upon discharge 
and was to return for a follow-up ECHO in ___ weeks.
