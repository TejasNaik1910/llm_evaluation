Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old gentleman with PMH including CAD s/p stenting,  dual 
chamber ICD, CHF LVEF of 40% mod MR, TR (___), atrial 
tach/fib on coumadin, s/p chemo + Rad + left coloectomy for 
rectal CA, h/o upper GIB from duodenal ectazia who was reffered 
by his PCP due to progressive fatigue and ___ Hct.
.
# Anemia: Mr. ___ had slowly ___ Hct prior to 
his admission w/o overt bleeding. On admission found to have 
microcytic anemia with Hct 24.7 and Retic. Index of 1.1%. 
Thought to be multifactorial d/t iron deficiency, CRF, Chronic 
disease. Concern for hemolysis was also raised (See "Jaundice" 
below). B12 and Folate were not deficient. Iron was low with 
Ferrittin at low end of normal range. He was hemodynamically 
stable throught his stay. Despite guiac negative stools history 
was concerning for potential sources of GI bleed including  s/p 
UGIB from duodenal ectasia and s/p rectal cancer. He underwent 
EGD which was normal. The patient declined colonoscopy at this 
time. Celiac serology was negative. He recieved a total of 3 
units of PRBC. Hct at discharge was 30.4 His coumadin was 
continued as he did not have signs of major bleeding. Omeprazole 
dose was reduced from 40mg BID to 20mg QD per normal EGD. Iron 
supplementation was started. He will require close monitoring of 
his Hct in the out-patient setting and further anemia workup 
including outpatient colonoscopy, UPEP, SPEP as well as 
hematology consultation for possible hemolysis. 
.
# CHF exacerbation. Mr. ___ has dilated cardiomyopathy 
with EF 40% per echo ___. He was clinically fluid overoladed on 
admission, likely ___ to decompensated HF in the setting of 
anemia. He was kept on his home doses of PO furosamide and 
recieved adittional IV furosamide dosing as well as PRBC for his 
anemia. Lisinopril, spironolacton and Metoprolol were continued. 
He had good urine output with this and his fluid status 
significantly improved to euvolumia at discharge. He will 
continue to follow-up with his outpatient cardiologist.  
.
# Jaundice: The patient was noticed to be Jaundiced and was 
found to have hyperbilirubinemia. Urobiilnogen + spoke against 
obstructive process. Raised LDH++ was concerning for hemolysis, 
but haptoglobin was normal and direct and indirect coombs 
testing was negative, no schistocytes were noted on smear. He 
does have chronic transamintis which is thought to be due to 
congested liver ___ to right heart failure. Worsening of liver 
congestion in the setting of decompensated heart failure may be 
the underlying cause of Jaundice. ___ syndrome is unlikely 
as he has no history of prior episodes of Jaundice. Trending of 
LFT's and further work-up should continue in the out-patient 
setting. Hematology consultation was arranged for work-up of 
possible hemolysis.   
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Admission Cr 1.7 up from 1.3 
at baseline, likely pre-renal failure in the setting of 
decompensated heart failure. Cr subsequently trended down to 
base-line with treatment of HF. Renal functions should be 
followed up in the out-patient setting. 

# Fever: Mr. ___ had a ___ temprature spike 
during a blood transfusion. Work-up for transfusion reaction was 
not concerning. Blood cultures were so far negative. He did have 
a cough but CXR was not concerning for pneumonia. UA was 
negative. He subsequently remained afebrile and had no 
leukocytosis. 
.  
# Atrial Fibrillation: patient is paced by dual chamber ICD. 
Rate control with BB and anticoagulatation with Warfaine were 
continued. His INR on discharge was 1.7. He will continue INR 
monitoring and warfarin dose adjustment in the out-patient 
setting.  
. 
# CAD: Patient is s/p stenting of the OM in ___ following 
cardiac arrest; His home medication regimen does not include 
aspirin and statin. He will continue follow up with his 
out-patient cardiologist. Initiation of aspirin and statin for 
seondary prevention should be considered.

Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
anemia
iron deficiency
suspected hemolysis
heart failure exacerbation

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted due to fatigue and shortness of breath. You 
were found to have anemia (low number of read blood cells) and 
worsening heart failure. We suspected bleeding from the 
intestine. You underwent upper endoscopy which did not 
demonstrate a source of bleeding in the upper part of your 
intestinal tract. You will need to undergo lower endoscopy 
(colonoscopy) to look for bleeding from the lower intestine. You 
were treated with medication to increase the amount of urine and 
decrease the accumulation of fluid in your body. You were also 
given blood units to treat your anemia. 
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
.
# Omeprazole 40 mg tablet was changed to omeprazole 20 mg 
tablet. Please take one tablet ONCE daily. 
.
# Iron 325mg tablet was added. Please take one tablet once 
daily. Please take with vitamin C and colace/senna stool 
softeners to avoid constipation.
.
Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.
