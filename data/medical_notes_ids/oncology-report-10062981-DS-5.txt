History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o man with a PMHx ___, HTN, HLD, 
and recent diagnosis of Stage IV NSCLC with brain mets s/p 
Cyberknife to the brain with recent admission to OMED ___ 
after for fall, presenting with another fall.

Rgarding his prior admission, he was found to have hip lytic 
lesion ___ metastasis without clear fracture. Per Trauma ortho, 
surgery was not recommended. He completed ___ Fr palliative 
radiation therapy on ___. During the hospitalization, he was 
also treated with abx for UTI (d/c'ed on cipro) and steroids for 
cerebral edema related to brain mets. He was discharged on 
dexamethasone 2mg PO daily.

Initially after d/c, the patient was doing OK for few days not

___ days, he has had worsening pain. While he was improving, he 
did not require any oxycodone, but has been taking PRN oxycodone 
___ times/day encouraged by his wife over the past couple days. 
On ___, when he was walking to turn off the light, he was 
shocked by the light switch and fell back on his R buttock/hip. 
He denies any preceding palpitations, LH, dizziness, 
unsteadiness on her legs, or nausea/flushing. He also denies 
headstrike or LOC during the fall. His wife was at home during 
this fall and came to help him up. His pain has been much worse 
since this fall. He and his wife called his outpatient 
oncologist, who recommended coming to the ED.

In ED, his vitals were 98 80 130/70 16 99% RA and he was noted 
to have severe pain with manipulation of RLE, He had R 
pelvis/hip/knee xrays negative for acute frx. On CT, he was

IMAGING:
---------
___ Knee ___: No acute fracture or dislocation.

___ Hip ___: No acute fracture or dislocation.  Lucent 
right acetabular lesion not clearly visualized.  If strong 
concern for fracture, CT advised.

___ CT Lower Extremity: A large lytic lesion in the right 
acetabulum concerning for metastatic disease has slightly 
increased in size.  There is cortical breakthrough as described 
above but no acute superimposed fracture or dislocation. 

___ CT Lower Extremity (Repeat to capture lower leg): There 
is a right hemi sacral fracture with extension into the S1 
neural foramen. Again seen is a 4.2 x 4.4 cm lytic lesion in the 
superior right acetabulum with apparent extension into the 
gluteus minimus. Given areas of cortical penetration, an 
underlying pathologic fracture is not excluded. 

___ CT Head without Contrast: Multiple areas of edema at

lesions although noncontrast CT has limited sensitivity. There 
is no evidence of hemorrhage. No change since the head CT of ___. 

___ CT Head without Contrast: No acute intracranial 
abnormality on noncontrast head CT. Edema in the right frontal 
lobe and right cerebellar hemisphere compatible with known 
metastatic disease, similar to prior exam.  Other supratentorial 
and infratentorial metastatic disease is better assessed on the 
recent MR. 

___ LABS:
----------------
None

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o man with PMHx ___, HTN, HLD, and 
recent diagnosis of Stage IV NSCLC with brain mets s/p 
Cyberknife. He was recently admitted after fall and found to 
have large soft tissue lesion consistent with bony metastasis 
involving the right acetabulum with cortical breakthrough and 
completed XRT to this region as well on ___. He was re-admitted 
5 days later w/ recurrent mechanical fall at home and 
exacerbation of R leg pain.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
------------------
# Right Acetabular Metastases: The patient has had significant 
RLE pain since prior admission due to known acetabular bony 
metastases. He completed 5 fractions of XRT on ___, with what 
appeared to transient improvement in his sx while at home. Prior 
to re-admission, however, he did, per his wife, begin to have 
recurring pain, which likely contributed to his fall. During 
this admission, he had imaging showing largely stable bony mets 
and was initially managed conservatively with pain medications. 
Per radiation oncology, he would not be candidate and would not 
likely benefit from further XRT. He was taken by ___ on ___ 
for cryoablation of R acetabular mets with cementoplasty with 
eventual improvement in his symptoms. He tolerated the procedure 
well and was slowly weaned off opiod medications. Prior to 
discharge, he was able to ambulate small distances with 
assistance of ___.

# Somnolence likely ___ Hypoactive Toxic-Metabolic 
Encephalopathy: During this admission, the patient triggered 
upon being found to be somnolent. He was without any focal neuro 
deficits, vital signs were within normal limits, and fingerstick 
blood sugars were normal. Most likely explanation for this acute 
event was felt to be likely hypoactive delirium in the setting 
of recent changes in oxycontin dosage and dexamethasone 
frequency, perhaps with resultant disturbance in sleep-wake 
cycle. Other considerations included acute intracranial bleed, 
not visualized on CT Head NC, and seizure. The patient quickly 
recovered with rapid improvement in mentation. Neuro-oncology 
was consulted, who did not feel keppra or further work-up for 
seizure to be indicated. They also recommended continuing the 
same dosage of dexamethasone pending repeat Brain MRI and 
neuro-oncology follow up.

# Acute Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: The patient had acute, 
waxing-waning mental status changes during this admission. This 
was also present during his last admission, and was again likely 
due to combination of pain from his metastatic lesions, sedating 
medications (mostly opiods), and other metabolic disturbances 
such as ___ and constipation. With largely treatment of his RLE 
metastatic lesions with cryo-ablation and cementoplasty and 
management of his pain, his mental status began to clear. 
Infection and new, primary CNS process was ruled out given his 
recent history of UTI and known history of intra-cranial mets. 
Prior to discharge, Mr. ___ was consistently ___ at 
his baseline.

# Fall due to baseline gait instability/deconditioning: Per 
patient, he appeared to have suffered a mechanical fall ___ pain 
and compromised balance I/s/o known ___ Disease and 
deconditioning (multiple recent hospitalizations). He denied any 
signs of syncope or seizure or antecendent symptoms suggestive 
of alternate etiology. He denied any injuries or head strike and 
imaging ___ in ED w/o fracture as above. CT Head was also 
unremarkable for any new intracranial abnormalities. His pain 
was managed as above and he worked closely with ___ throughout 
this admission prior to ultimate discharge to rehab.
  
# Stage IV NSCLC: The overall plan for Mr. ___ had been to 
resume chemotherapy after his clinical condition had stabilized, 
following his most recent admission. This re-admission further 
delayed chemotherapy and ultimately, his goals of care shifted 
based on multiple family meetings held during this 
hospitalization between the patient, his primary team, and 
palliative care. As he was not felt to be safe at home due to 
his baseline gait instability and weakness, the patient was 
discharged to short term rehab with goal of transitioning to 
home and possibility of hospice thereafter.

CHRONIC/STABLE/RESOLVED PROBLEMS:
# HSV Dermatitis: The patient developed a small herpetiform rash 
c/w HSV dermatitis around his sacrum and was treated empirically 
with 7 days of PO acyclovir with good effect.

# ___ due to pre-renal azotemia/Stage II CKD: The patient 
presented with Cr of 1.1, at baseline, c/w stage II CKD. During 
this admission, amidst waxing and waning mentation with 
subsequent poor PO intake, his Cr rose to 1.4. With IVF and 
encouraged PO, his Cr returned back to baseline.

# ___ Disease: The patient was continued on his home 
dose of Carbidopa/Levadopa during this hospitalization.  
# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was continued on his 
home lantus and ISS on admission. This was adjusted due to poor 
PO intake initially and subsequently re-adjusted for rising 
FSBG's in the setting of increased steroid dosage. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Per multiple family meetings held during this admission and 
concerns about medical safety in the home setting, the patient 
was discharged to short term rehab, with hopes for possible 
transition to home.
-Should patient not be able to come home, consider evaluation 
for long term placement and/or initiation of hospice services at 
that time
-The patient's steroid dosage for cerebral edema ___ 
intra-cranial metastases was increased from 2mg PO q24H to 2mg 
PO q12H. Per Neuro-oncology, the patient was maintained on this 
dosage on discharge and would need repeat Head MRI and 
Neuro-Oncology follow-up to decide further steroid regimen.
-The patient should follow-up with his primary oncologist 
regarding setting up any Neuro-Oncology appointments as needed 
and for further management of his cancer overall
-Patient was treated with 7-day course of PO acyclovir for 
recurrent, local HSV dermatitis (R lumbar back)
-Given patient's underlying ___ Disease, the patient 
should not be given any first-generation anti-psychotic 
medications or anti-dopaminergic agents
-CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI
-Contact Information for Primary Oncologist: ___ 
(___)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you felt weak and fell 
at home. On admission, you were also in a lot of pain from the 
cancer in your right leg as well as from your fall. You were 
given medications to help with your pain. You also underwent a 
procedure to remove some of the cancer in your leg and stabilize 
the bone. Your pain improved significantly after this procedure 
and you were even starting to walk with physical therapy.

During this hospitalization, we also held a family meeting with 
you, your wife, and doctors from multiple ___ in the hospital 
to discuss your overall goals of care. It was felt that you 
would most benefit from being in a place where you could have 
supported care 24 hours a day, which you would not be able to 
receive at home. As such, you were discharged to short term 
rehab to work on your strength and hopefully be able to 
transition you back home. 

Please take note of the changes in your home medications and 
follow up with your outpatient doctors ___ detailed in the rest 
of your discharge paperwork).

Thank you for allowing us to be a part of your care,
Your ___ Team
