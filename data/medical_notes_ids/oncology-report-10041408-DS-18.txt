poor output and minimal decrease in size, the findings were 
discussed with the team, and it was decided to upsize the 
catheter which will be performed tomorrow.   
2. Stable post-Whipple appearance of the abdomen.  
3. New small right pleural effusion and bilateral bibasilar 
atelectasis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with metastatic pancreatic cancer (s/p ___ 
with liver mets s/p RFA ___, with hepatic abscess at RFA 
which was drained under CT guidance ___, admitted for continued 
pain at drain site and bradycardia after procedure.
 
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Bradycardia:  No history of arrhythmias in the past.  Question 
if this could have been a medication effect, given that she had 
received numerous narcotics throughout the day and the event was 
preceded by multiple doses of dilaudid.  Her claminess also 
suggests possibly a vasovagal reaction, which may have been in 
response to the pain from her procedure.  Monitored on telemetry 
with no further events other than PVCs. 
 
# Liver abscess:  Studies on fluid were sent, and gram stain 
positive for GNRs.  Started on meropenem on ___ per ID 
recommendations. Abscess fluid grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella and 
S. viridans, so her antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone 1g 
IV q24h and metronidazole 500mg q8h on ___.  Repeat CT 
abdomen on ___ to assess abscess drainage showed minimal change 
in size, so the catheter was exchanged for a larger catheter on 
___.  She will need to keep the drain in with output recorded 
every shift while at rehab.  Once the drain is putting out <5 
cc/day for 2 days, she will be seen by ___ ___ NP) 
to have her catheter checked and possibly pulled.  From an 
infection standpoint, she will be followed by Infectious Disease 
in the ___ clinic.  Course of antibiotics will be determined by 
Dr. ___ and ___ depend on how well the abscess is 
draining.  Weekly labs (CBC w diff, BMP, and LFTs) will be 
obtained throughout the duration of her abx therapy and faxed to 
ID RN at ___.  
  
# Pain:  complained of pain at drain site and occasional 
referred right shoulder pain when lying down. Pain control was 
an ongoing issue throughout her stay.  She would often not 
request pain medication until she was in ___ pain, then she 
would recieve stacked doses and become overly sedated. She never 
required narcan, but she would complain of feeling "groggy" and 
"out of it".  After consulting with palliative care, she was 
started on a regimen of dilaudid 2 mg PO q3h standing with 
strict instructions to hold when she was sleeping or overly 
sedated.  This regimen seemed to work better for her although 
she did have one dose held on the day of discharge due to some 
"grogginess." She will be discharged to rehab on this regimen, 
but she should be carefully monitored for pain and doses 
titrated to her pain needs.  
 
# Pleural effusion:  found to have tiny pleural effusion on 
admission, which increased slightly while she was an inpatient.  
She did not have radiographic or clinical evidence of pneumonia. 
 She did, however, require 2L by NC to keep her O2 sats >91%.  
We would expect this effusion to begain resolving as the 
inflammation in her liver begins to go down.  She should 
continue using incentive spirometry while in rehab to help with 
the surrounding atelectasis.
  
CHRONIC, INACTIVE ISSUES:
# Metastatic pancreatic cancer:  has a follow up appointment 
scheduled for ___ with her primary oncologist 
 
# Bipolar disorder: continued abilify, wellbutrin, lamotrigine, 
klonipin
  
# DVT: continued lovenox 
 
TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES:
- Antibiotics: will continue ceftriaxone and metronidazole for a 
prolonged course, length to be determined by ID ___ to 
follow - ___. She needs to have weekly CBC with diff, 
chem panel, and liver function tests drawn and faxed to ID nurse 
at ___. All questions regarding outpatient antibiotics 
should be directed to the infectious disease R.Ns. at ___ or to on call MD in when clinic is closed 
- Abscess perc drain: Please flush with 10cc NS with firm pull 
back and record output q8hrs. If drain output is < 5 cc for at 
least 2 days, call ___ NP ___ at ___ to arrange 
follow up for possible drain removal. Please call ___ if 
there is any concern about the management of the percutaneous 
drain.
- Pancreatic cancer: has follow up appointment with Heme/Onc on 
___
- Pain control: please give dilaudid every 3 hours, but may hold 
while she is sleeping or if she is overly sedated. Please 
titrate dosage to pain needs as her pain from the drain 
improves. Monitor respiratory rate prior to each dose.
- Provide oxygen supplement to maintain O2 Sat > 91%.
- ___ was DNR/DNI this admission

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
 
You were admitted to the hospital following drainage of your 
liver abscess due to a slow heart rate (bradycardia) and 
continued pain at your drain site.  We monitored you on 
telemetry, and we found no more episodes of bradycardia.  We 
think that this was cause either by some of the medications you 
had been given or by your body's reaction to the pain from the 
procedure.
 
In order to treat the infection within your liver abscess, you 
will need to continue taking intravenous antibiotic ceftriaxone 
and metronidazole.  The Infectious Disease doctors ___ be 
following along with you and will re-image your abscess at a 
later date to help decide how long you need to stay on 
antibiotics.
 
Your drain will be left in until the draining slows down to less 
than 5 ml per day for 2 days in a row.  The interventional 
radiology nurse ___ call the rehab to check on the amount of 
drainage to decide when the drain should be removed. 
  
Changes to your medications:
START dilaudid 2 mg by mouth every 3 hours (may be held if you 
are sleeping, feeling groggy, or completely pain free)
START tylenol ___ mg every 8 hours
START Ceftriaxone 1gm IV every 24 hours - duration to be 
determined by Dr. ___ (Infectious Disease)  
START Metronidazole 500mg by mouth every 8 hours - duration to
