CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  ___ 8:___HEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: please evaluate pleural space and airways 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old man with new diagnosis of L NSCLC here for IP eval 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate pleural space and airways 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: pt is allergic to contrast 
dye

PROCEDURE: CT chest without contrast on ___.

COMPARISON: None similar are available.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the 
thoracic inlet to the subdiaphragmatic area without contrast. 
Thinner slice 5 mm and 1.25 mm images were reconstructed in the 
axial plane at different window algorithms. Sagittal/coronal 
reformatted images were also obtained for further evaluation.

HISTORY: ___ man with new diagnosis of left non-small 
cell lung cancer here for evaluation. Evaluate pleural space and 
airways.

FINDINGS: 7 x 9 x 10-cm lobulated heterogeneous soft tissue mass 
with multiple areas of low attenuation likely necrosis are seen 
involving the left lung with endoluminal involvement of the left 
main bronchus before its bifurcation causing almost complete 
collapse of the left lung and leftward shift of the 
cardiomediastinal structures. The non-collapsed part of the left 
lung base demonstrates peribronchovesicular thickening. The 
adjacent pleural space is invaded with presence of a loculated 
pleural effusion superiorly and multiple soft tissue nodularity. 
The effusion is mainly confined to the left upper hemithorax 
lateral compartment. There is a left chest drainage catheter 
introduced from the left chest wall close to the base with the 
tip terminating at the level of the carina.

Subpleural lucencies are seen along the right margin of the 
right upper lobe indicative of mild paraseptal emphysema. A 
clustered area of lucency is seen in the right upper lobe 
adjacent to the fissure with adjacent ground-glass opacity and 
another area is noted in the right lower lobe likely 
pneumatoceles, sequelae of prior infection.

A solid nodule in the right lobe of the lung (3:45) measures 4.5 
mm.

There is no right pleural effusion. There is minimal pericardial 
effusion confined to the left pericardial space with associated 
nodularity and infiltration of the mediastinal fat. Extensive 
atherosclerotic calcifications are seen involving the origin of 
the major vessels including the brachiocephalic trunk, the 
carotid and the left subclavian artery, in addition, extensive 
atherosclerotic calcifications are seen involving the coronary 
arteries both right and left, left more than right. A focus of 
calcification is seen involving the chorda tendineae of the left 
ventricle, a sequela of prior old myocardial infarction.

Within the mediastinum, mainly to the left are multiple 
non-fat-containing pathologically enlarged lymph nodes; 2 cm 
left prevascular lymph node, 1.4 cm left prevascular lymph node, 
1.5 cm subcarinal lymph node, 8 mm right hilar lymph node.

The bony structures do not show any lesions suspicious for 
malignancy and/or infection.

The limited evaluation of the abdomen demonstrates multiple 
rounded hypodense lesions of the liver. Atherosclerotic 
calcifications are seen involving the aorta. A portion of the 
descending thoracic aorta measures 5 cm in maximum dimension.

Adrenal glands are normal. The bony structures do not show any 
lesions suspicious for malignancy and/or infection; significant 
degenerative spine disease.

IMPRESSION:

1. Large left lung mass with endobronchial invasion of the left 
bronchus starting approximately 3.5 cm from the carinal 
bifurcation with complete occlusion of the left main bronchus. 
Lymphangitic spread of portion of the left lower lobe, multiple 
pathologically enlarged left mediastinal lymph nodes , pleural 
metastatic implant and loculated effusion and liver lesions are 
highly suggestive of an advanced primary lung cancer. However, 
liver MRI examination is recommended for better evaluation of 
the liver.

2. The descending thoracic aorta is aneurysmally dilated 
measuring 5 cm with extensive atherosclerotic calcification of 
its wall. This requires a contrast-enhanced CT angiogram 
examination for evaluation of the aorta.

3. Extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the coronarys and 
the major vessels of the aortic arch. Mild paraseptal emphysema. 
Prior areas of infection are seen in the right lung 
characterized by small pneumatoceles and associated ground-glass 
opacities.

4. 4.5-mm single nodule is seen in the right lower lobe of the 
liver which by itself is non-specific; however, can be followed 
up on multiple future chest CT scan examinations.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  ___ 3:06 ___

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: interval change, infilrate? 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old man with NSCLC, SOB, s/p thoracentesis 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
interval change, infilrate? 
TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest PA and lateral.

INDICATION: Non-small-cell lung cancer, shortness of breath, 
status post thoracocentesis. Evaluate for interval change.

FINDINGS: AP and lateral chest views obtained with patient in 
sitting upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with a 
preceding single AP chest view of ___. The previously 
described almost total opacification of the left hemithorax 
persists. There is some evidence of partial re-aeartion of the 
left lung consistent with some removal of pleural effusion and 
corresponding volume increase of aerated lung tissue. No 
pneumothorax has developed. The right-sided lung remains 
unaltered without evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or 
acute infiltrates. For detail of original left-sided lung mass 
see report on corresponding chest CT report of ___.

Name:  ___            ___ No:  ___

Service:  OME                     Date:  ___

Date of Birth:  ___        Sex:  M

Surgeon:  ___, ___

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Flexible bronchoscopy.

INDICATION:  Newly diagnosed non-small cell lung carcinoma
with airway obstruction.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  Informed consent was obtained from the
patient after explaining the risks and benefits. Conscious
sedation was initiated with intravenous Versed and fentanyl.
One percent lidocaine was sprayed with an atomizer in the
hypopharynx and over the larynx. A flexible bronchoscope was
advanced via the oral route. Vocal cord movement appeared to
be normal. After instilling 1% lidocaine on the vocal cords,
the bronchoscope was advanced into the trachea. Evaluation of
the airways revealed mild to moderate tracheomalacia
involving the distal trachea and moderate bronchomalacia
involving the right mainstem bronchus. The left main-stem
bronchus appeared to be compressed by extrinsic tumor.
Bronchoscope could be advanced into the distal left main-stem
bronchus. Intrinsic tumor was then seen at the secondary
carina with no normal airways identifiable distal to this.
Following this the procedure was terminated. The bronchoscope
was withdrawn. The right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius,
right middle and lower lobe segmental bronchi all appeared to
be normal.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without any
complications.

chemotherapy.  He completed carboplatin etoposide without 
complicaitons.  He was begun on epogen and received his first
