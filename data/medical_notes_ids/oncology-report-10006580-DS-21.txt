Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old female with a right carotid body 
tumor who was admitted to the ___ 
___ on ___. The patient was taken to the endovascular 
suite and underwent angioembolization of her tumor. For details 
of the procedure, please see the surgeon's operative note. Pt 
tolerated the procedure well without complications and was 
brought to the post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition. 
She subsequently underwent resection of right carotid body 
tumor, with preservation of the internal and external carotid 
arteries and facial nerve monitoring on ___. After a brief 
stay, pt was transferred to the vascular surgery floor where she 
remained through the rest of the hospitalization.

Post-operatively, she did well without any groin swelling nor 
facial or other neuro deficits. She remained neurologically 
intact throughout her hospitalization.  She had a right JP drain 
below her incision to monitor drainage which initially was 
sanguineous but soon became sero-sanguineous. By POD 4 the 
draining volume had decreased to less than 30mL per day and the 
drain was removed. 

She was able to tolerate a regular diet, get out of bed and 
ambulate without assistance, void without issues, and pain was 
controlled on oral medications alone. She was deemed ready for 
discharge, and was given the appropriate discharge and follow-up 
instructions.
