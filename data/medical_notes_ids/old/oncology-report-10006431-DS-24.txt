pain

# Pancreatitis
# Abdominal pain: 
Patient with one week of progressive worsening of epigastric
abdominal pain/nausea. Found to have elevated lipase and OSH
imaging suggestive of acute inflammation c/w pancreatitis flare

elevation in LFT's to suggest acute obstruction. Pain has been
largely insidious since diagnosis of pancreatic ca so possibly
acute pancreatitis but largely pain is due to the tumor hence

chemotherapy, unfortunately found to have metastatic liver
disease intraoperatively. Recently progressive after 6C
