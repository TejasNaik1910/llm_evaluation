IMAGING
=======
___: CT CHEST WTIHOUT CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:  
Overall similar appearance of the large posterior mediastinal 
mass resulting in esophageal obstruction, as well as invasion of 
the carina and bilateral mainstem bronchi. There is 
approximately 50% narrowing of bilateral main stem bronchi 
proximal to the endobronchial stents. 
  
Interval increase in the left lower lobe bronchial obstruction, 
with 
associated worsening left lower lobe consolidation and 
atelectasis. 

___: CHEST PORTABLE (AP)
IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the scout radiograph of the CT examination 
dated ___, there is again bilateral hilar prominence 
consistent with invasion of the carina and mainstem bronchi from 
a large posterior mediastinal mass.  The bronchial stents are 
not definitely appreciated on the current study. 
Increased opacification at the lung left base was shown to 
represent a combination of lower lobe atelectasis and 
consolidation. 

___: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION:  
Comparison to ___, 05:05.  The right paramediastinal 
mass appears 
slightly larger than on the previous examination.  Moreover, 
there is a new opacity projecting over the aortopulmonary 
window.  Lung volumes have 
decreased.  The newly placed endobronchial stent is not directly 
visualized.

___: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION:  
As compared to the previous image from ___, 22:22, the 
paramediastinal and perihilar opacities have improved and the 
lung has 
increased in transparent see.  Also improved is a retrocardiac 
atelectasis.  
The tracheal stent is not directly visualized.  Borderline size 
of the heart.  
No pneumothorax.

___: CHEST PORTABLE
Comparison to ___.  Status post esophageal stent 
placement.  The 
paramediastinal opacity on the right is stable.  Mild elevation 
of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged.  There currently is no 
evidence for the presence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.  A small 
retrocardiac atelectasis is stable in extent and severity. 

___. New ground-glass opacity of the right upper lobe and 
increased 
peribronchiolar nodularity at the right lung base, compatible 
with sequela of aspiration and/or hemorrhage after bronchoscopy. 
 Improvement of left lower lobe consolidation. 
2. Unchanged posterior mediastinal mass, now with patent airways 
after 
tracheal stenting.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
====================================================
___ y/o female with history of recent (___) diagnosis of 
adenocarcinoma of the lung now s/p bronchial stenting (at ___ 
___, depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, and sciatica. She 
was initially seen at ___ where she has been seeing 
Dr. ___ and Dr. ___ with plan for 
initiation of palliative chemo and radiation. She was admitted 
for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and was found to have 
increased bronchus narrowing due to increased size of mass. She 
was transferred to ___ for stenting. She underwent tracheal 
(___) and esophageal (___) stent placements. She requests 
transfer back to ___ for urgent initiation of 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================================================
#) Hypoxemia Secondary to Lung Adenocarcinoma and 
Post-Obstructive Pneumonia: 
- s/p tracheal Y stenting ___ with improvement in symptoms. 
However, developed recurrent SOB requiring another bronchoscopy 
on ___ showing occlusion requiring re-stenting. Following this, 
she had stabilization of dyspnea and hypoxia (on room air at 
discharge)
- continued on Vanc/MTZ for concern of post-obstructive PNA. 
MRSA isolated from bronchial washings. Continue a 10 day course 
(___)

#) Non-small cell lung cancer: Recent diagnosis with mapping and 
plan for palliative chemo and radiation at ___. She 
was evaluated by Heme Onc and ___ Onc at ___, who recommended 
initiation of therapy as soon as possible given rapid growth and 
obstructive complications. Therapy was offered here at ___, 
but patient prefers transfer back to ___, so that 
her sister/HCP can have ease of travel. She is followed by Dr. 
___ (Radiation Oncologist) and Dr. ___ 
(Oncology) at ___. She was maintained on a diluadid 
PCA for pain control.

#) Dysphagia: She has dysphagia secondary to esophageal 
compression by mass. She was seen by the ERCP team at ___ and 
underwent esophageal stent placement on ___ with improvement in 
symptoms. She was started on BID PPI due to pain related to the 
stent. She should continue on a dysphagia soft diet due to her 
stent.

#) Tachycardia: Patient was noted to have episodes of 
tachycardia with bigeminy/trigeminy vs Afib that was 
asymptomatic. Blood pressures stable during periods of 
tachycardia. Likely secondary to mediastinal mass burden. 
- started on low dose metoprolol which will likely need to be 
titrated up.
 
#) Oral candidiasis: Patient was started on nystatin (day 1: 
___

CHRONIC ISSUES:
====================================================
#) Depression/Anxiety/Fibromyalgia: She was continued on her 
home alprazolam, buspirone, and escitalopram. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
- initiation of palliative XRT and chemotherapy
- Continue Vanc/MTZ through ___
- uptitration of metoprolol as needed for tachycardia
- transition to oral pain regimen
