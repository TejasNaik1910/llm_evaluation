History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old man with pmh significant for CAD 
s/p multiple stents to LAD, RCA, and LCX presenting with chest 
pain while recovering in the PACU from Laparascopic 
cholecystectomy.  The patient had been experiencing symptoms of 
biliary colic for a week.  He had an ERCP on ___ during which he 
underwent sphincterotomy with removal of multiple stones.  The 
patient then returned on ___ with similar abdominal pain and 
underwent laparascopic cholecystectomy today.  While in the PACU 
he developed chest pain which was relieved by dilaudid.  ECG at 
this time showed ST depressions in V1-V4, and ST elevations in 
I, II, and III.  Bedside echo showed LVEF of ___ with 
posterior wall hypokinesis and mitral regurgitation.  The 
patient was started on heparin IV, beta blocker, and aspirin.  
He was also hypertensive during this episode with blood 
pressures 160/100.  He was started on nitro and had foley 
placed, after which his blood pressure dropped to 130/80's, his 
pain resolved and his ekg changes resolved as well.

On admission to the CCU the patient is in noticable discomfort.  
he was reporting epigastric burning pain with nausea.  He 
reported the pain was unlike his anginal episodes.  His anginal 
episodes usually present as substernal pressure.  The patient 
was on 5mcg of nitro gtt at the time without resolution of pain. 
 an ekg taken at this time did not show ischemic ekg changes. 

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, 
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG ___- Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats. Non-specific 
ST-T wave changes. 
Consider myocardial ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing 
of ___ 
ST-T wave changes and atrial premature beats are new. 

ECHO ___- The left ventricular cavity size is top 
normal/borderline dilated. There is mild to moderate regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and lateral 
hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size appears normal with 
preserved free wall motion in focused views. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. Very mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Cardiac Cath ___. One-vessel significant coronary artery 
disease with very late stent thrombosis of LCX 
2. Successful thrombectomy, PTCA, and drug-eluting stenting of 
the LCX. 

ECHO ___- The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe 
hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and distal 
lateral wall. The remaining segments contract well (LVEF 
35-40%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. Mild [1+] aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is high normal. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a fat pad. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year old man with diabetes, coronary artery 
disease, presenting with a STEMI in the setting of hypertension 
while recovering from laparoscopic cholecystectomy, s/p 
thrombectomy with DES to LCX at cath lab with hospital course 
complicated by lower GI bleeding.
.
# CORONARIES: Patient has a history of significant cortonary 
artery disease s/p multiple percutaneous coronary interventions. 
 His chest pain was accompanied by EKG changes and a newly 
depressed ejection fraction to 35-40%, along with posterior wall 
hypokinesis.  He continued to have chest pain with CE elevation 
and was taken to the cath lab on ___.  The cath showed 
two-vessel disease.  The LCx had moderate in-stent restensosis 
and thrombus extending from the proximal portion to the middle 
of the vessel.  The RCA had diffuse mild disease and minimal 
in-stent restenosis and a moderate discrete lesion in the mid 
PDA. He had a successful thrombectomy, PTCA, and stenting of the 
proximal and mid LCx with a 2.5 x 28mm Xience drug eluting stent 
which was postdilated to 3.0mm. Final angiography revealed no 
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis, and 
TIMI 3 flow. His CEs showed a peak CK=2140 with Trop 3.88 and MB 
143 on ___.  Patient was continued on aspirin and plavix upon 
return to the unit.  Experienced occasional chest discomfort 
while in-house but each episode was mild and lasted no more than 
10 seconds.  No EKG changes.  Upon discharge, patient was 
comfortable.  Denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, 
palpitations, edema.  He will need to be continued on aspirin 
325mg indefinitely as well as Plavix 75mg daily for at least one 
year. He is also on metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily and high 
dose Atorvastatin. 
.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal 
atrial fibrillation.  He converted to normal sinus rhythm after 
amiodarone was started and he was amiodarone loaded with 400mg 
BID for 1 week.  He will be discharged on amiodarone 400mg daily 
for 1 week and then amiodarone 200mg daily indefinitely.  
Coumadin was held in the setting of his lower GI bleed and he 
will continue on metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily
.
# BRBPR: The patient has known radiation proctitis s/p XRT for 
prostate cancer.  He had a colonoscopy with argon plasma 
coagulation in early ___ for a GI bleed then.  His GI bleed was 
reactivated once anticoagulation was restarted before his 
cardiac cath.  His hematocrit dropped significantly and he 
required 5 units of pRBCs during his hospital course to maintain 
his hematocrit.  GI was consulted and at first recommended 
Carafate enemas to help coat his known radiation proctitis 
ulcers.  These enemas seemed to induce bowel movements which 
further irritated his GI bleed.  They were discontinued and the 
patient was scheduled for a repeat flex sig with argon plasma 
coagulation in an attempt to stop the bleeding source.  This 
took place ___ and was successful, although GI reports that he 
will likely rebleed and need a repeat procedure as an 
outpatient. 
.
# Acute renal failure: His baseline creatinine was around 1.2, 
but was 1.8 on admission.  It was likely of pre-renal etiology 
and his creatinine improved with increased PO intake and holding 
his Lasix. Low dose Lasix was restarted on discharge as his 
creatinine had normalized.  
.
# Cholecystectomy: He initially had an elevated white count s/p 
procedure which resolved. Surgery followed him throughout his 
admission. He was able to tolerate a low fat diet prior to 
discharge. He is scheduled to see his surgeon after discharge. 
.  
# Hypertension: He did have some hypotension early on in his 
admission.  His home metoprolol and valsartan were continued on 
discharge. 
.  
# Acute Systolic Congestive heart failure: His clinical exam was 
monitored closely to evaluate his fluid status and his home dose 
lasix of Lasix was restarted at discharge.   
.  
# Diabetes mellitis: Blood sugars were well controlled on an 
insulin sliding scale in addition to glipizide.
.  
# ___ disease: His home selegiline was continued.
.  
# Gout: His home colchicine was continued on discharge after 
being held in the setting of his acute coronary syndrome.
.  
# Migraine and cluster headaches: Pain was treated with Percocet 
PRN and his home cyclobenzaprine with good effect.
.
CODE: The patient's code status was confirmed as full code.
