Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Worsening dyspnea and rash
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bone Marrow biopsy (___)
Skin biopsy (___)
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ YO F with a history of COPD (FEV1 56% on 
___, ___, seizure disorder secondary to AVM , and  ACA 
aneurysm on 4 AEDs  who presented with worsening dyspnea on 
exertion and skin rash found to have a significantly elevated 
eosinophil count. 

Of note, she was noted on CT to had pulmonary nodules, 
mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bone lesion concerning for 
malignancy during a hospitalization for ___ - ___. 
She underwent transbronchial biopsy of hilar lymph node, which 
returned negative for malignant cells  and flow cytometry showed 
nonspecific T-cell dominant lymphoproliferation not consistent 
with malignancy. She was treated with steroids, antibiotics and 
diuresis.  She states that she had been experiencing progressive 
pruritus for about one year and that the rash appeared a few 
months ago. She notes that she had not quite felt like herself 
since that admission with decreased stamina and lower energy.

Per her discharge summary (___) , she was admitted to 
___ for dizziness on ___ . She was noted to be hypoxemic 
and underwent
 chest CT, VATS biopsy, and flow cytometry, which showed 
eosinophilic infiltrate with fibrosis but no granulomas or 
vasculitis on lung biopsy  (no eosinophils in lung parenchyma 
just in capillaries) as well as a skin biopsy which  showed 
subacute spongiotic dermatitis with mixed inflammatory 
infiltrate and prominent perivascular and 
interstitial eosinophilic component, consistent with a florid 
hypersensitivity reaction concerning for drug reaction. But was 
advised not to stop her AEDs by her primary PCP.  She was then 
transferred to the ___ for further management on ___.

On this admission (___) she had an extensive infectious, 
rheumatologic and oncologic work up  for the eosinophilia, which 
was largely negative except for a  positive for strongyliodes 
and ID was consulted. She had no history  suggestive for 
Strongyloidiasis (travel to endemic areas) and all stool samples 
have been negative for ova and parasites. Steriods were held 
during this admission for fear of strongyloides. She received 
two doses of ivermectin on ___ and ___ and was discharge 
(___). She had extensive skin testing for allergy to her 
medications including antiepileptics which was largely negative. 
She states that she had been experiencing progressive pruritus 
for one year and that the rash appeared a few months ago. 

Since her discharge (___), she has noted significant progressive 
fatigue and shortness of breath  that has significantly limited 
her ability to complete her normal daily activities. Activities 
such as showering take her close to an hour. She states that she 
has not noticed any significant weight change in that period but 
is unsure because she does not measure her weight. She notes 
that about a week and a half ago prior to presentation, she was 
switched from her furosemide 40 mg BID to Ethacrynic acid 25 mg 
QAM. She also notes ___ edema but states that this is not unusual 
for her. About 3 days prior to presentation, she called her 
pulmonologist about her difficulty breathing was told to 
increase her Ethacrynic acid to 50 mg BID. She states that her 
O2sat at home is usually in the 90's but noticed that it was 
~85% on the day prior to presentation and 79% on morning of 
presentation. She has been using home oxygen more consistently 
for the week prior to presentation. She went to her infectious 
disease appointment for her ___ scheduled dose of Ivermectin on 
___ and was noted to be short of breath, requiring supplemental 
oxygen to breath comfortably. She was then referred to inpatient 
medicine.   
 
on presentation to the  ED, vitals were: 98.7 90 107/61 21 89% 
RA. She was noted to have crackles and wheezing on exam. Labs 
remarkable for H/H 11.4/35 (at baseline)  ___ 20.9, N:36 Band:0

which was unremarkable. She recieved nebulizers and 40 lasix IV 
with mild improvement in her SOB. She also recieved benadryl IV 
for itching and 324 ASA. She was admitted to medicine for 
further management. At time of transfer, vitals were 98.8 80 
___ 97% Nasal Cannula. On arrival to the floor, the 
patient was complaining of diffuse itch, though her SOB was 
somewhat improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with medical history of COPD, ___ and recently 
hospitalization for hypoxia, rash and hypereosinophilia who 
presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion, worsening skin 
rash and Hypereosinophilia.

#Eosinophilia: On presentation she was noted to have WBC 20.9, 
with substantial hypereosinophilia (Eos 51 % and absolute eos 
10.66). She previously had an extensive work up for the cause of 
her eosinophilia (infectious, hematalogic, oncologic, 
rheumatologic, allergic) which was largely negative except for a 
positive strongyloides for which she was treated with Ivermectin 
(prior to this admission) without resolution of her symptoms. 
This was ultimately thought to be a false-positive result based 
on the fact that she actually had no exposure history. She was 
noted to have eosinophilic lung and skin infiltrates as well as 
T-cell polyclonal predominance on BM. Tumor lysis labs (K, LDH, 
Uric acid, transaminases) and a peripheral smear were sent (___) 
for concern for acute malignant transformation leading to the 
profound eosinophilia but were not consistent with an acute 
transformation. She was followed by several teams including 
heme/onc, pulm, derm and cards. It was felt that her 
hypereosinophilia was likely due to a secondary 
lymphocytic-predominant hypereosinophilic syndrome for which the 
treatment is steriods. She was started on prednisone 40mg with 
rapid steady drop in WBC and %eos (___). The prednisone was 
increased to 60mg (___) when the %eos was noted to have 
plateaued at ~10% on 40mg. She was discharged on Prednisone 60mg 
with the plan to taper after %eos <5% in the outpatient setting. 
She was discharged with close allergy and pulmonology follow-up.

# Shortness of breath: On presentation to the ED she was 
afebrile and satting 89% RA. Labs were notable for a WBC 20.9 
with 50% eos (absolute eos 10.66)BNP 14000. She was also noted 
to have crackles and wheezing on exam. Pulmonary edema was noted 
on chest X-ray. He SOB was thus thought to likely be due to her 
COPD as well as an acute dCHF exacerbation. She received 
nebulizers and IV diuresis (lasix) with minimal improvement in 
her SOB. TTE to evaluate cardiac function showed LVEF >75% as 
well as new LVOT obstruction, thought to contribute minimally to 
her symptoms. Given her history of markedly elevated Eosinophil 
count and extensive work up (as above), eosinophilia-driven 
dyspnea was considered. She had a lung biopsy on a previous 
admission which showed eosinophilic infiltrate but no evidence 
of granulomas. She was also noted to be ANCA negative. Cardiac 
MRI showed no evidence of eosinophilia infiltration or 
myocarditis. Prednisone (for COPD) was initially held for fear 
of worsening her respiratory status in the setting of 
strongyloides, however, given she had been treated for 
strongyloides and that this diagnosis was much les likely, she 
was started on prednisone. Continued diuresis and nebulizers did 
not improve her symptoms substantially. Several teams were 
consulted including Pulmonology, Dermatology, and Cardiology but 
the etiology of the respiratory shortness of breath remained 
unclear. After considerable deliberation, the consensus was that 
she likely had a lymphocytic-variant of hypereosinophilia 
syndrome and she was started on prednisone 40mg with significant 
improvement in her respiratory symptoms along with her COPD meds 
and gentle diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO QD to maintain an even 
total body water balance and stable daily weights. The dose of 
Prednisone was increased to 60mg just prior to discharge due to 
a plateau as above. She was slowly weaned from 5L of 
supplemental O2 and discharged on 1L O2.

# ___ on CKD: She was noted to have a Cr on 1.5 on presentation 
from a baseline of 1.1  ___s K of 5.4. It was initially 
thought to be due to CHF exacerbation vs eosinophilia related 
(malignant proliferation vs direct damage). Tumor lysis labs 
were mildly elevated but not suggestive of tumor lysis syndrome 
as the cause of the renal injury. She recieved IV diuresis 
without improvement. Nephrology was consulted and determined 
that ___ was most likely due to ___ in the setting of agressive 
diuresis and exposure to contrast given recent CT with contrast. 
Urine analysis was bland and not suggestive of eosinophil driven 
nephropathy. Creatinine returned to baseline with reduction of 
IV diuresis. Discharge creatinine was 1.3.

# Rash: Appearance consistent with a drug rash but extensive 
allergy testing done prior and lack of new recent exposures made 
this less likely. Skin lesion biopsied which showed superficial 
and deep perivascular dermatitis with eosinophils and focal 
spongiosis, suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction to 
systemic antigen.  thought to be related to hypereosinophilia 
syndrome. Improved with initiation of oral and topical steriods. 
Also treated with Cetirizine, low dose Gabapentin, and several 
anti-histamines.

#Hyperkalemia: Noted to have elevated K of 5.4 on admission. 
Improved as renal function improved as stated above. Noted to be 
again elevated at 6.3 despite recovered renal function. Unclear 
etiology but likely dietary. She states that she had been 
ingesting K rich foods (tomato soups, melons etc). No sign of 
hemolysis on blood smear or highly metabolis states associated 
with rapid turnover. Medications not likely contributory. She 
had an EKG at the time which was normal. Got Lasix 40mg IV and 
Kayexalate 30mg with recheck that showed K 5. Switched to low K 
diet after which K downtrended and remained stable for the 
remainder of stay. 

# Hypertension: treated with Amlodipine 10 mg and furosemide 
40mg PO QD. Permissive hypertension was allowed given new LVOT 
obstruction. She will be somewhat preload and afterload 
dependent, and care should be taken not to reduce either of 
these parameters substantially.

# History of Seizures: Continued on home Lamotrigine, 
Levetiracetam, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin Sodium. levels were 
checked after starting Prednisone to ensure therapeutic levels.
 
# Full code

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES***
- Will need a repeat IgE, spirometry and lung volumes to assess 
response to treatment in the outpatient setting once steroid 
taper commences. 
- Was found to have new LVOT with an increased gradient during 
this admission. Should she develop dizziness, lightheadedness or 
syncope, consider worsening LVOT as a possible etiology. Avoid 
over diuresis as well as aggressive preload/afterload reduction.
- hyperkalemia: resolved with low K diet. She should continue 
with a low K diet.
- discharged on Prednisone 60mg PO daily, will need taper
- discharge weight: 98.6 kg, Discharge diuretic regimen: Lasix 
40mg PO daily
- stable mediastinal lymph nodes noted on imaging: given 
relative stability over time, it is less likely to be 
neoplastic, though an indolent lymphoproliferative disorder 
cannot be completely excluded and these should be followed in 
the outpatient setting.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay 
at ___. You were admitted 
because of your shortness of breath, worsening rash and because 
you had a very high level of a specific type of blood cell, 
called an Eosinophil.  We initially treated your COPD and heart 
failure with medications but those did not seem to fully improve 
your symptoms. Several different specialists were involved in 
your care, and you had a lot of tests done which did not show a 
definite cause. We believe that the eosinophils were driving 
your symptoms and treated you with Prednisone to suppress the 
eosinophils with good improvement of your symptoms. It does not 
appear that your symptoms are due to a cancer in the blood (this 
was ruled out with a biopsy of the bone marrow, the factory that 
makes blood cells in the body. This was also unlikely to be from 
infectrion and medication effect. We continued to treat your 
symptoms such as shortness of breath and itchiness with 
nebulizers, creams and other medication. You did very well, and 
it is now safe for you to be discharged. Please be sure to take 
all of your medications as prescribed and keep your follow-up 
appointments. In particular, please continue to take the 
prednisone. You will be slowly tapered off Prednisone after your 
eosinophil counts are sufficiently low. Also, try to avoid 
stressors as much as possible at home, and take several days to 
ease back into things at home. We wish you the very best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ team
