___ AB US
IMPRESSION:
 
1.  Ultrasound guided diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis 
yielding 1 L of
straw-colored ascitic fluid.  Samples were sent to the lab for 
analysis. 
 
2.  Extensive hepatic metastatic disease.  

___ CXR: 
FINDINGS:
Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the 
SVC and right
atrium.  The heart size is normal.  The aorta is mildly 
unfolded.  Mediastinal
and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.  The pulmonary 
vasculature is
normal.  Lungs are clear.  No focal consolidation, pleural 
effusion or
pneumothorax is visualized.  Several clips are seen in the left 
axilla.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F w/ metastatic breast cancer presents with worsening 
abdominal distention and concern for progression of known 
hepatic metastasis v. malignant ascitic fluid accumulation.

# Malignant ascites- Has obvious disease progression on exam 
with palpable hepatomegaly and nodules on her liver. Also with 
evidence of a positive fluid wave. She underwent paracentesis 
with 1L of fluid removal. The patient was concerned that her 
fluid had already re-accumulated. She was informed that this is 
likely but that the re-accumulation of fluid would be gradual. 

# metastatic breast cancer - Refusing palliative chemotherapy. 
Was planning on continuing alternative therapies with her 
outside provider. 

# hyponatremia - Urine lytes with inappropriately high Na+ 
indicating likely etiology SIADH. Also, did not respond to 
fluids.  

# GERD - re-started omeprazole

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___. You came into the hospital because you 
noticed that your abdomen had been increasing in size over the 
past few weeks. This was limiting your mobility. After you came 
into the hospital, you had a procedure done to take fluid off 
your abdomen. You had about one liter of fluid taken off. You 
felt better after this. 

Your sodium level was found to be low while you were in the 
hospital. You were given fluids, which can help improve this. 
You need to have a sodium level re-checked as an outpatient on 
___.

You are also anemic. We think this is related to your cancer but 
should have this followed up as an outpatient. You have several 
abnormalities on your lab values that we would like to manage 
while you are in the hospital but since you want to go home, you 
should have lab work done as an outpatient to follow up your 
liver enzymes, uric acid, and LDH.   

Thank you for choosing ___.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
