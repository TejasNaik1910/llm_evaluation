Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is an ___ woman with a history of breast 
cancer and newly diagnosed thyroid nodule suspicious for 
papillary cancer who has now
presented with mediastinal lymphadenopathy which has grown
very quickly. She has had workup with an EBUS with biopsy of
level VII lymph node which showed suspicion for lymphoma.
Patient was brought to the OR for Left video-assisted 
thoracoscopic 
surgery parietal pleural biopsy, effusion evacuation, and
bronchoscopy.

Post-Op: Patient was stable with little pain on exam. CT was 
placed on suction and diet was advanced as tolerated. 

POD 1: Patient complained of mild incisional site pain with 
positive response to Dilaudid. She was started on Colace and 
maintained oxygen sat at 93-95% on 4L NC. She was subsequently 
weaned down to 2L NC. She continued to tolerated her diet and 
IVF were decreased. 

CXR: In comparison with prior study, there is little change in 
the 
appearance of the left chest tube and extensive opacification 
involving the 
lower half of the left lung. Dilatation of a gas-filled stomach, 
for which 
nasogastric tube might prove helpful.  

POD 2: Patient re-mained on telemetry w/o events. CT remained to 
suction with 
serosanguinous outputs. No leak was observed and no crepitus in 
the chest wall was appreciable. Patient was weaned to 1.5L NC 
and reported 1 BM. 

CXR: Unchanged left lower lobe and middle lobe opacity, 
consistent 
with post-surgical changes, or residual lung mass. Pneumonia 
cannot be ruled 
out, but is less likely. 

POD 3: CT placed to water seal. Patient was weaned of 02 and 
maintained sat's at 93% on RA. Pain was well controlled with 
Tylenol. Discharge planning was initiated and patient was 
thought to be fit for discharge home with services. Follow-up 
CXR showed findings listed below.

CXR:  Again seen is a left-sided chest tube. There is a new 
loculated 
pneumothorax in the left upper lung laterally.  

POD 4: Patient continued to be stable with good PO-intake, 
adequate UOP and minimal pain. Given recent CXR patient was kept 
for a day and Patient CT was clamped at 9:00pm. Repeat CXR 
showed stable loculation with no new pneumothorax. 

POD 5: Patient continued to be stable. CT was removed 
uneventfully and post-pull CXR was ordered. Patient continued to 
be stable with stable vital prior to discharge.
