Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with history of HTN, COPD, IDDM, 
hypothyroidism, DVT who originally presented with diarrhea, SOB, 
and headache x ___ days, found to have severe hypervolemic 
hyponatremia that improved with diuresis and discontinuation of 
her hydrochlorathiazide. She was found to have iron deficiency 
anemia and dysphagia for which she underwent EGD and colonoscopy 
without pertinent findings.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=======================
#Hypotonic, Hypervolemic Hyponatremia
Admitted with severe hyponatremia to 111. Etiology was mostly 
hypervolemia due to diastolic heart failure exacerbation and 
HCTZ use. We d/c'd HCTZ and placed a fluid restriction and 
initiated pharmacologic diuresis with loop diuretics until the 
patient was euvolemic. Patient originally had symptomatic 
headaches, confusion, and shortness of breath; these all 
improved with diuresis. Renal was consulted and made 
recommendations about an outpatient diuretic regimen with 
torsemide 10 mg PO QD. The patient's Na normalized to 141 by 
discharge and she was asymptomatic. 

#Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
Patient originally presented with severe bilateral lower 
extremity edema, orthopnea, shortness of breath, and severely 
elevated BNP. LENIs were negative. Responded well to diuresis as 
above. Was euvolemic at discharge. Discharge weight: 110.4 kg. 
Discharge Cr: 0.8.

#Anemia
Hgb remained consistently low with microcytic pattern during 
admission. Ferritin was low-normal and TIBC was high-normal. 
Patient also described ongoing weight loss and change in stool 
patterns (alternating diarrhea/constipation + worm-like stools). 
Last colonoscopy in ___ included removal of 17 polyps and 
recommendation for follow-up colonoscopy in ___ year, which 
patient did not get. She received both a colonoscopy and an EGD 
as an inpatient. Had one colonic polyp removed and random 
biopsies sent. EGD was notable for mild gastritis with antral 
erosions (no stricture). 

#Change in stool habits
Patient reported 10 days of watery diarrhea prior to admission. 
She also described change in stool formation 
("worm/pebble-like"). Diarrhea was likely viral gastroenteritis 
given time course. C diff was negative. After admission patient 
was constipated for 1 week. This resolved with a bowel prep that 
was done in preparation of an inpatient colonoscopy to evaluate 
for iron deficiency anemia (see above). IgA levels and 
transglutaminase antibodies were sent, both negative.  

#Dysphagia
Patient complained of discomfort while swallowing during 
admission. Was evaluated by speech and swallow who found no 
oropharyngeal pathology. EGD showed mild gastritis, no evidence 
of esophageal stricture. 

#Klebsiella UTI
Patient had UA concerning for infection upon admission, 
speciated to Klebsiella. Was treated with ceftriaxone x 3 days 
with good result. Subsequently denied urinary discomfort. 

#Vulvovaginal candidiasis
#Urinary retention
Patient had vaginal discharge and inner groin rash consistent 
with candidiasis. Responded very well to PO fluconazole and 
miconazole powder. Pt originally had Foley upon admission which 
was discontinued. Pt had one day of urinary retention which 
later resolved. Likely was due to UTI / prolonged Foley 
placement. 

# Hypoxia/dyspnea
Patient had acute on chronic dyspnea during hospitalization. Has 
40 pack year smoking history and COPD. Generally felt with 
activity. CXR without evidence of pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or 
pleural effusion. LENIs negative as above. Patient's oxygenation 
improved with 2L NC, later weaned to RA. She was also given 
standing Duonebs. 

#Hyperglycemia
Patient was managed on an insulin sliding scale. PO 
anti-hyperglycemics were held.

#Sore throat
Patient complained of sore throat that was managed with throat 
lozenges and chloraseptic spray with good response. Likely a 
viral pharyngitis. No erythema or exudates on exam. 

#Hypomagensia
Patient had hypomagnesmia upon admission that normalized with 
administration of MgSO4.

CHRONIC ISSUES
========================
# History of seizures: Continued home keppra

# Hypertension: Home losartan was increased from 25 to 50 mg PO 
QD. Eventually may benefit from increasing home losartan to 100 
mg but holding off currently i/s/o ongoing diuresis; continue 
metoprolol

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home pravastatin.

# Diabetes: Received insulin SSI while in house.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine 175 mcg.

Transitional issues
[ ] HFpEF: patient to be discharged on PO torsemide 10 mg QD as 
maintenance diuretic. Please adjust PRN to maintain weight and 
euvolemic status. 
Discharge dry weight 110.4 kg. Discharge Cr 0.8.
[ ] GI biopsies: F/u on pathology from colonoscopy random 
biopsies and polypectomy. F/u on EGD biopsy pathology of antral 
erosions. 
[ ] Mild gastritis: counsel patient to avoid NSAIDS given hx of 
microcytic anemia and gastritis on EGD
[ ] Weight loss, poor appetite: patient should receive 
age-appropriate cancer screening and PHQ-9 screening as 
outpatient for follow-up for poor appetite and weight loss.   
Patient endorsed weakness, confusion, poor appetite for several 
weeks prior to admission.  ? if this was due to low sodium that 
had been present for some time.   She denied symptoms of 
depression.  
[ ] Patient noted to have iron deficiency anemia throughout 
hospitalization. Colonoscopy and EGD revealed one polyp and mild 
gastritis. Pt should have follow up for ongoing anemia with 
monitoring of symptoms. 

Greater than ___ hour spent on care on day of discharge.
